DNA was isolated from ischemic muscles collected at day 7 after ischemia induction using DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). 5 µg of genomic DNA was sheared into small fragments with a mean size of 150 bp by using a Covaris™ S2 sonicator System. Quality of the fragmentation was analyzed with Bioanalyzer. Fragmented DNA samples were used for preparation of DNA fragment libraries and sequenced on the SOLiD4 sequencing instrument on one flow cell for 50 bp reads. The sequencing reads were mapped to mus musculus genome build mm9. Data was analyzed by using Bioscope. The samples were normalized with the MEDIPS package in R/B Bioconductor. The analysis of CpG methylation was done primarily in the proximal promoter regions encompassing a region of –1kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and +500 bp downstream of the TSS. Comparisons were performed between hyperlipidemic versus controls and diabetic versus controls to detect differentially methylated regions. R package Limma was used for performing the statistical testing between the groups.;	Results: When visualizing the whole normalized data the samples did not cluster according to the sample groups. Especially two samples from hyperlipidemic and diabetic ischemic muscles differed clearly from the rest of the samples. To detect the differentially methylated genes, stringent thresholds for p-values and fold change values were chosen to list a reasonable number of genes. Upon filtering, significant differences in the methylation patterns of the sample groups were observed. More importantly, when clustering only the filtered genes, the samples clustered clearly according to the sample groups giving evidence of condition-dependent behavior. Using a threshold of methylation fold change of >1.2 and p value <0.05, we identified 397 and 446 genes to be hypomethylated in hyperlipidemic and diabetic ischemic muscles respectively compared to controls. There were 46 genes commonly shared, but still having a unique pattern of hypomethylation in 371 and 394 genes in hyperlipidemic and diabetic ischemic muscles respectively compared to controls. Similarly, there were 371 and 394 genes hypermethylated in hyperlipidemic and diabetic ischemic respectively compared to controls. Interestingly, we found 264 genes to be commonly hypermethylated, whereas 107 and 130 genes were uniquely hypermethylated in hyperlipidemic and diabetic ischemic muscles respectively. Thus, proximal promoter methylation suggested a shared, yet distinct pattern of DNA methylation in ischemic muscles of hyperlipidemic and type 2 diabetic mice compared to controls. Out of 397 genes that were hypomethylated in hyperlipidemic ischemic muscle, 68 genes were shown to be upregulated in ‘proinflammatory M1 macrophages’ as shown by recent studies. Similarly, out of the 371 hypermethylated genes 93 genes were shown to be upregulated in ‘anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic M2 macrophages’ as described recently. Out of 446 hypomethylated genes in diabetic ischemic muscle, 65 genes were shown to be upregulated in ‘proinflammatory M1 macrophages’ as shown recently. Similarly, out of 394 hypermethylated genes 105 genes were specifically upregulated in ‘anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic M2 macrophages’ as shown recently. qRT-PCR analysis suggested an inverse relationship between proximal promoter hypermethylation and mRNA expression in a subset of M2 macrophage specific genes in hyperlipidemic and type 2 diabetic ischemic muscles compared to control ischemic muscles.;	Conclusions: Our results suggest a role of epigenetics particularly proximal promoter DNA methylation in macrophage polarization and their contribution to angiogenesis and tissue repair in hyperlipidemic and type 2 diabetic mouse models of hind limb ischemia. Epigenetics at the level of DNA methylation may act as a deciding factor in promoting a pro or anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages critical in cardiovascular diseases."

C57BL/6J (WT) mice fed with regular chow-diet (R36, Lactamin) served as controls. All animals were aged between 20 to 24 weeks at the time of hindlimb operations. For sorting macrophages from ischemic muscles, ischemic gastrocnemius muscles were minced and enzymatically dissociated using a cocktail containing 450 U/mL Collagenase I, 125 U/mL Collagenase XI, 60 U/mL DNAseI, and 60 U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then counted and divided into CD31+ve and CD31-vefractions using CD31 magnetic bead enrichment (Miltenyi Biotec). For macrophage sorting CD31-ve fraction was incubated for 15 minutes with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (Fc Block, BD-pharmingen) and stained with FITC conjugated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (Serotec) for 20 minutes at 4˚C. For endothelial sorting CD31+ fraction was incubated for 15 minutes with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (Fc Block, BD-pharmingen) and stained with APC conjugated rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD-pharmingen) and FITC conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 ((BD-pharmingen) for 20 minutes at 4˚C. FACS sorting was performed on FACS AriaIII (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA was isolated from FACS sorted macrophages and endothelial cells using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen Finland, Helsinki, Finland) according to manufacturer's instructions.;	Results: The sample similarity as assessed by Pearson’s correlation matrix and Hierarchial clustering showed high correalation among macrophages, as well as endothelial cells. There was a clear clustering of macrophages and endothelial cells as evidence by their CpG methylation clustering, furthermore macrophages from HL and T2DM mice showed clear clustering compared to control macrophages. Differential methylation analysis of RRBS methylation data from macrophages and endothelial cells was performed using Methylkit. Using a threshold of adjusted p value (Q) <0.05 and percentage methylation difference of >5%, we identified 198 and 272 genes whose promoters were hypomethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages. Similarly, there were 102 and 136 gene promoters were hypermethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages, respectively compare to control macrophages. Thus, proximal promoter methylation suggested that HL and T2DM have convergent influences on the proximal promoter methylation of numerous macrophage specific genes. In order to find out whether these genes with differential methylated promoters were differentially expressed at  mRNA expression level in purified macrophages, we further compared our data with the GEO datasets as above. Of the 198 genes with promoter hypomethylation in HL macrophages 72 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1- Mϕs; whereas, of the 102 genes with promoter hypermethylation, 51 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs. Similarly, out of 272 genes with differentially methylated promoters in T2DM macrophages 88 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1-Mϕs; whereas, out of 136 genes with promoter hypermethylation 60 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs. Thus a significant promoter hypomethylation of M1-Mϕ and hypermethylation of M2-Mϕ genes suggested the predominance of proinflammatory M1-Mϕs in ischemic muscles of HL and T2DM compared to M2-Mϕs in control mice.;	Conclusions: We found significant promoter hypomethylation of genes typical for proinflammatory M1-Mϕs and hypermethylation of anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic M2-Mϕ associated genes in HL and T2DM ischemic muscles. Epigenetic alterations  skewing Mϕ phenotype towards proinflammatory as opposed to anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic and tissue repair phenotype may contribute to impaired adaptive vascular growth in these pathological conditions."

Similarly, out of 272 genes with differentially methylated promoters in T2DM macrophages 88 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1-Mϕs; whereas, out of 136 genes with promoter hypermethylation 60 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs. Thus a significant promoter hypomethylation of M1-Mϕ and hypermethylation of M2-Mϕ genes suggested the predominance of proinflammatory M1-Mϕs in ischemic muscles of HL and T2DM compared to M2-Mϕs in control mice.;	Conclusions: We found significant promoter hypomethylation of genes typical for proinflammatory M1-Mϕs and hypermethylation of anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic M2-Mϕ associated genes in HL and T2DM ischemic muscles. Epigenetic alterations  skewing Mϕ phenotype towards proinflammatory as opposed to anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic and tissue repair phenotype may contribute to impaired adaptive vascular growth in these pathological conditions."

C57BL/6J (WT) mice fed with regular chow-diet (R36, Lactamin) served as controls. All animals were aged between 20 to 24 weeks at the time of hindlimb operations. For sorting macrophages from ischemic muscles, ischemic gastrocnemius muscles were minced and enzymatically dissociated using a cocktail containing 450 U/mL Collagenase I, 125 U/mL Collagenase XI, 60 U/mL DNAseI, and 60 U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then counted and divided into CD31+ve and CD31-vefractions using CD31 magnetic bead enrichment (Miltenyi Biotec). For macrophage sorting CD31-ve fraction was incubated for 15 minutes with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (Fc Block, BD-pharmingen) and stained with FITC conjugated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (Serotec) for 20 minutes at 4˚C.

FACS sorting was performed on FACS AriaIII (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA was isolated from FACS sorted macrophages and endothelial cells using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen Finland, Helsinki, Finland) according to manufacturer's instructions.;	Results: The sample similarity as assessed by Pearson’s correlation matrix and Hierarchial clustering showed high correalation among macrophages, as well as endothelial cells. There was a clear clustering of macrophages and endothelial cells as evidence by their CpG methylation clustering, furthermore macrophages from HL and T2DM mice showed clear clustering compared to control macrophages. Differential methylation analysis of RRBS methylation data from macrophages and endothelial cells was performed using Methylkit. Using a threshold of adjusted p value (Q) <0.05 and percentage methylation difference of >5%, we identified 198 and 272 genes whose promoters were hypomethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages. Similarly, there were 102 and 136 gene promoters were hypermethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages, respectively compare to control macrophages. Thus, proximal promoter methylation suggested that HL and T2DM have convergent influences on the proximal promoter methylation of numerous macrophage specific genes. In order to find out whether these genes with differential methylated promoters were differentially expressed at  mRNA expression level in purified macrophages, we further compared our data with the GEO datasets as above. Of the 198 genes with promoter hypomethylation in HL macrophages 72 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1- Mϕs; whereas, of the 102 genes with promoter hypermethylation, 51 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs.

C57BL/6J (WT) mice fed with regular chow-diet (R36, Lactamin) served as controls. All animals were aged between 20 to 24 weeks at the time of hindlimb operations. For sorting macrophages from ischemic muscles, ischemic gastrocnemius muscles were minced and enzymatically dissociated using a cocktail containing 450 U/mL Collagenase I, 125 U/mL Collagenase XI, 60 U/mL DNAseI, and 60 U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then counted and divided into CD31+ve and CD31-vefractions using CD31 magnetic bead enrichment (Miltenyi Biotec). For macrophage sorting CD31-ve fraction was incubated for 15 minutes with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (Fc Block, BD-pharmingen) and stained with FITC conjugated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (Serotec) for 20 minutes at 4˚C. For endothelial sorting CD31+ fraction was incubated for 15 minutes with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (Fc Block, BD-pharmingen) and stained with APC conjugated rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD-pharmingen) and FITC conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 ((BD-pharmingen) for 20 minutes at 4˚C. FACS sorting was performed on FACS AriaIII (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA was isolated from FACS sorted macrophages and endothelial cells using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen Finland, Helsinki, Finland) according to manufacturer's instructions.;	Results: The sample similarity as assessed by Pearson’s correlation matrix and Hierarchial clustering showed high correalation among macrophages, as well as endothelial cells. There was a clear clustering of macrophages and endothelial cells as evidence by their CpG methylation clustering, furthermore macrophages from HL and T2DM mice showed clear clustering compared to control macrophages. Differential methylation analysis of RRBS methylation data from macrophages and endothelial cells was performed using Methylkit. Using a threshold of adjusted p value (Q) <0.05 and percentage methylation difference of >5%, we identified 198 and 272 genes whose promoters were hypomethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages. Similarly, there were 102 and 136 gene promoters were hypermethylated in HL and T2DM macrophages, respectively compare to control macrophages. Thus, proximal promoter methylation suggested that HL and T2DM have convergent influences on the proximal promoter methylation of numerous macrophage specific genes. In order to find out whether these genes with differential methylated promoters were differentially expressed at  mRNA expression level in purified macrophages, we further compared our data with the GEO datasets as above. Of the 198 genes with promoter hypomethylation in HL macrophages 72 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1- Mϕs; whereas, of the 102 genes with promoter hypermethylation, 51 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs. Similarly, out of 272 genes with differentially methylated promoters in T2DM macrophages 88 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M1-Mϕs; whereas, out of 136 genes with promoter hypermethylation 60 genes were suggested to be upregulated in M2- Mϕs. Thus a significant promoter hypomethylation of M1-Mϕ and hypermethylation of M2-Mϕ genes suggested the predominance of proinflammatory M1-Mϕs in ischemic muscles of HL and T2DM compared to M2-Mϕs in control mice.;	Conclusions: We found significant promoter hypomethylation of genes typical for proinflammatory M1-Mϕs and hypermethylation of anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic M2-Mϕ associated genes in HL and T2DM ischemic muscles. Epigenetic alterations  skewing Mϕ phenotype towards proinflammatory as opposed to anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic and tissue repair phenotype may contribute to impaired adaptive vascular growth in these pathological conditions."

The gene expression analysis indicated a gradient of induction of inflammatory mediators, and repression of PPAR-signaling and oxidative phosphorylation.

We identified 450 lncRNAs which were differently regulated by ischemia including novel lncRNAs expressed in antisense orientation to major myocardial transcription factors GATA4, GATA6 and KLF6.

In conclusion, GRO-Seq allowed us to follow the gradient of gene expression occurring in the ischemic heart and identify novel ncRNAs regulated by oxygen deprivation.

The inability to accurately model human disease in mice impedes the study of complex phenotypes and critically limits the discovery and testing of potential therapeutics. Laboratory mice have longer telomeres (>40 kilobases (kb)) compared to humans (~5-15 kb), potentially protecting them from age-related disease caused by haploinsufficiency. In humans, heterozygous non-sense mutations in the transcription factor, NOTCH1 (N1), lead to severe age-dependent aortic valve (AV) calcification. However, mice heterozygous for N1 do not develop calcific AV disease (CAVD)5. Here, we show that telomere shortening is sufficient to elicit age-dependent cardiac valve disease in N1+/- mice that closely mimics the human disease and that progressive shortening correlates with severity of disease, extending to AV thickening in the neonate. N1 haploinsufficiency led to increased proliferation in valves that further reduced telomere length. Calcified AVs exhibited downregulation of osteoclast factors and upregulation of pro-calcific regulatory nodes concordant with gene network alterations in human N1 heterozygous endothelial cells. Dysregulated genes in valves were enriched for those that have promoters normally contacted by telomere looping. These findings reveal a critical role for telomere length in a mouse model of age-dependent human disease that may have broader implications and provides an in vivo model in which to test therapeutic candidates to prevent or delay the progression of CAVD."

The inability to accurately model human disease in mice impedes the study of complex phenotypes and critically limits the discovery and testing of potential therapeutics. Laboratory mice have longer telomeres (>40 kilobases (kb)) compared to humans (~5-15 kb), potentially protecting them from age-related disease caused by haploinsufficiency. In humans, heterozygous non-sense mutations in the transcription factor, NOTCH1 (N1), lead to severe age-dependent aortic valve (AV) calcification.

Although smooth muscle cells (SMC) produce and respond to collagens in vitro, there is no direct evidence in vivo that SMC are a critical source of collagens impacting lesion development or fibrous cap formation. We sought to determine how conditional SMC specific knockout of collagen type XV (COL15A1) in SMC lineage tracing mice effects advanced lesion formation. COL15A1 was chosen because: 1) we previously identified a Col15a1 sequence variant associated with age related atherosclerosis; 2) COL15A1 is a matrix organizer that enhances tissue structural integrity; and 3) siRNA mediated Col15a1 knockdown increased migration and decreased proliferation of SMC in vitro. We hypothesized that SMC derived COL15A1 is critical in advanced lesion pathogenesis and fibrous cap formation. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that SMC specific Col15a1 knockout mice fed a Western diet for 18 weeks failed to form advanced lesions. SMC Col15a1 knockout lesions have a drastic reduction in overall lesion size, cell accumulation, and the absence of a SMC and ECM- rich lesion or fibrous cap. In vivo RNA-seq analysis on lesions +/- SMC Col15a1 knockout suggests the mechanism for these effects is complex and associated with reductions in multiple pro-atherogenic inflammatory pathways in multiple cell types involved in lesion development. These results thus provide the first direct evidence that a SMC derived collagen is critical during lesion pathogenesis.

We therefore investigated the role of KLF4 in EC function through comparing the transciptional profiling of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were infected with adenovirus overexpression KLF4 (Ad-KLF4) or with empty vector (Ad-null) control.  Gene ontology analysis revealed that KLF4 not only regulates EC homeostasis through the upregulation of nitric oxide synthesis and vascular development, but also mediates response to lipid.  Among the lipid responsive genes, KLF4 exhibited induction of cholesterol efflux and oxidation [i.e., liver X receptor (LXR) and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h)], while suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis [i.e., sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2)]."

"The cellular and molecular aspects of post-infarct left-ventricle remodeling in presence of type-2 diabetes is poorly understood. In this study we have addressed the cellular and molecular aspects underlying post-infarct left-ventricle remodeling in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mice using genome-wide mRNA-sequencing. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligating left-anterior descending artery (LAD) in 12-14 month old T2DM and control mice. Cardiac MRI was performed at baseline, day 7 and 14 post-LAD ligation. Blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and immunohistochemical, molecular biology analysis after sacrification at day 7 and 14.  Genome-wide mRNA sequencing analysis was performed from left-ventricular tissues collected at day 7 post-LAD ligation. Mitochondrial dynamics, Leukocyte recruitment and Collagen I deposition were analyzed using electron microscopy, fluorescent assisted cell sorting (FACS) and fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy from left ventricular tissues collected at day 7 and 14 post-LAD ligation. Cardiac ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV) were significantly reduced along with increased mortality in T2DM compared to controls. Ingenuity pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes were enriched for mitochondrial dysfunction, TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, upstream transcription factor analysis showed inhibition of PGC1a, PGC1b, ESRRA, ESRRB and TFAM in infarcted myocardium of T2DM mice. Electron microscopy analysis showed an altered mitochondrial dynamics and cardiomyocyte death in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. Leukocytes exhibited an altered phenotype in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. Neovascularization was impaired and collagen deposition was increased in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. We conclude that an altered mitochondrial dynamics, cell death modalities, leukocyte phenotype, neovascularization responses and fibrosis may contribute to an increased mortality after myocardial infarction in T2DM.

"The cellular and molecular aspects of post-infarct left-ventricle remodeling in presence of type-2 diabetes is poorly understood. In this study we have addressed the cellular and molecular aspects underlying post-infarct left-ventricle remodeling in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mice using genome-wide mRNA-sequencing. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligating left-anterior descending artery (LAD) in 12-14 month old T2DM and control mice. Cardiac MRI was performed at baseline, day 7 and 14 post-LAD ligation. Blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and immunohistochemical, molecular biology analysis after sacrification at day 7 and 14.  Genome-wide mRNA sequencing analysis was performed from left-ventricular tissues collected at day 7 post-LAD ligation. Mitochondrial dynamics, Leukocyte recruitment and Collagen I deposition were analyzed using electron microscopy, fluorescent assisted cell sorting (FACS) and fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy from left ventricular tissues collected at day 7 and 14 post-LAD ligation. Cardiac ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV) were significantly reduced along with increased mortality in T2DM compared to controls. Ingenuity pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes were enriched for mitochondrial dysfunction, TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, upstream transcription factor analysis showed inhibition of PGC1a, PGC1b, ESRRA, ESRRB and TFAM in infarcted myocardium of T2DM mice. Electron microscopy analysis showed an altered mitochondrial dynamics and cardiomyocyte death in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. Leukocytes exhibited an altered phenotype in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. Neovascularization was impaired and collagen deposition was increased in ischemic myocardium of T2DM mice. We conclude that an altered mitochondrial dynamics, cell death modalities, leukocyte phenotype, neovascularization responses and fibrosis may contribute to an increased mortality after myocardial infarction in T2DM.

By performing bone marrow transplant experiments into LDLR-/- mice, our work demonstrates that the effects of miR-33 in macrophages play a major role in its ability to reduced atherosclerotic plaque burdon.  To have performed extensive additional characterization of the effects of miR-33 deficiency in macrophages icluding RNA-seq analysis of peritoneal macrophages from wildtype, miR-33-/-, LDLR-/-, and miR33-/-/LDLR-/- animals.;	Methods:  Thioglycolate elicited peritoneal macrophages from WT and miR-33-/- mice were harvested by peritoneal lavage.  Cells were then plated for 2hr, then washed to remove non-adherant cells.  Macrophages were then scraped, pelleted and frozen at -80◦C. Total RNA from WT and miR-33-/- thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages was extracted and purified using a RNA isolation Kit (Qiagen) followed by DNAse treatment to remove genomic contamination using RNA MinElute Cleanup (Qiagen). The purity and integrity of total RNA sample was verified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). rRNA was depleted from RNA samples using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina). RNA libraries from WT BMDMs were performed TrueSeq Small RNA Library preparation (Illumina) and were sequenced for 45 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platformm (1 x 75bp read length). The reads obtained from the sequencer are trimmed for quality using in-house developed scripts.  The trimmed reads are aligned to the reference genome using TopHat2.  The transcript abundances and differences calculated using cuffdiff.  The results were plotted using R and cummeRbund using in-house developed scripts.;	Results:  Our RNA-seq analysis has allowed us to identify genes and pathways that are altered in miR-33 deficient peritoneal macrophages under hyperlipidemic conditions (LDLR-/- vs. miR33-/-/LDLR-/-).

However, the natural history of the disease is characterized by continuous relapses over time. As a consequence, the development of new drugs is still required to treat MM recurrence. Here, we report for the first time the potent anti-myeloma activity of amiloride, an old potassium-sparing diuretic approved for the treatment of hypertension and edema due to heart failure. Amilorideinduced apoptosis was observed in a broad panel of MM cell lines and in xenograft mouse models. Moreover, amiloride also had a synergistic effect when combined with dexamethasone and melphalan. RNA-seq experiments showed that amiloride not only significantly altered the level of transcript isoforms and alternative splicing events, but also deregulated the spliceosomal machinery. Additionally, disruption of the splicing machinery in immunofluorescence studies was associated with the inhibition of myeloma cell viability after amiloride exposure. Although amiloride was able to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells lacking p53 expression, activation of p53 signaling was observed in wild-type and mutated TP53 cells after amiloride exposure. On the other hand, the manageable toxicity profile of amiloride is well known and we did not find a significant systemic toxicity in mice treated with amiloride. Overall, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the use of amiloride as an alternative treatment option for relapsed MM patients."

Here, we report for the first time the potent anti-myeloma activity of amiloride, an old potassium-sparing diuretic approved for the treatment of hypertension and edema due to heart failure. Amilorideinduced apoptosis was observed in a broad panel of MM cell lines and in xenograft mouse models. Moreover, amiloride also had a synergistic effect when combined with dexamethasone and melphalan. RNA-seq experiments showed that amiloride not only significantly altered the level of transcript isoforms and alternative splicing events, but also deregulated the spliceosomal machinery. Additionally, disruption of the splicing machinery in immunofluorescence studies was associated with the inhibition of myeloma cell viability after amiloride exposure. Although amiloride was able to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells lacking p53 expression, activation of p53 signaling was observed in wild-type and mutated TP53 cells after amiloride exposure. On the other hand, the manageable toxicity profile of amiloride is well known and we did not find a significant systemic toxicity in mice treated with amiloride. Overall, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the use of amiloride as an alternative treatment option for relapsed MM patients."
