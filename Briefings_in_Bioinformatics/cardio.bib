Sequencing the human genome gave new insights into human biology and disease. However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of each protein. Uhl\'en et al. now present a map of protein expression across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of expression patterns across the human body.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body would greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on quantitative transcriptomics on a tissue and organ level combined with protein profiling using microarray-based immunohistochemistry to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. We provide a global analysis of the secreted and membrane proteins, as well as an analysis of the expression profiles for all proteins targeted by pharmaceutical drugs and proteins implicated in cancer.
RATIONALE We have used an integrative omics approach to study the spatial human proteome. Samples representing all major tissues and organs (n = 44) in the human body have been analyzed based on 24,028 antibodies corresponding to 16,975 protein-encoding genes, complemented with RNA-sequencing data for 32 of the tissues. The antibodies have been used to produce more than 13 million tissue-based immunohistochemistry images, each annotated by pathologists for all sampled tissues. To facilitate integration with other biological resources, all data are available for download and cross-referencing.
RESULTS We report a genome-wide analysis of the tissue specificity of RNA and protein expression covering more than 90\% of the putative protein-coding genes, complemented with analyses of various subproteomes, such as predicted secreted proteins (n = 3171) and membrane-bound proteins (n = 5570). The analysis shows that almost half of the genes are expressed in all analyzed tissues, which suggests that the gene products are needed in all cells to maintain ``housekeeping'' functions such as cell growth, energy generation, and basic metabolism. Furthermore, there is enrichment in metabolism among these genes, as 60\% of all metabolic enzymes are expressed in all analyzed tissues. The largest number of tissue-enriched genes is found in the testis, followed by the brain and the liver. Analysis of the 618 proteins targeted by clinically approved drugs unexpectedly showed that 30\% are expressed in all analyzed tissues. An analysis of metabolic activity based on genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS) revealed liver as the most metabolically active tissue, followed by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSIONS A freely available interactive resource is presented as part of the Human Protein Atlas portal (www.proteinatlas.org), offering the possibility to explore the tissue-elevated proteomes in tissues and organs and to analyze tissue profiles for specific protein classes. Comprehensive lists of proteins expressed at elevated levels in the different tissues have been compiled to provide a spatial context with localization of the proteins in the subcompartments of each tissue and organ down to the single-cell level.

All tissue-enriched proteins are shown for 13 representative tissues or groups of tissues, stratified according to their predicted subcellular localization. Enriched proteins are mainly intracellular in testis, mainly membrane bound in brain and kidney, and mainly secreted in pancreas and liver.
Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray\textendash{}based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90\% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.},

However, stagnation in the development of new cardiovascular therapies and variability in therapeutic response implies that this paradigm is insufficient for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden. In this state-of-the-art review, we~examine 3 interconnected ideas we put forth as key concepts for enabling a transition to precision cardiology: 1)~precision~characterization of cardiovascular disease with machine learning methods; 2) the application of network models of disease to embrace disease complexity; and 3) using insights from the previous 2 ideas to enable pharmacology and polypharmacology systems for more precise drug-to-patient matching and patient-disease stratification. We conclude by exploring the challenges of applying a precision approach to cardiology, which arise from a deficit of the required resources and infrastructure, and emerging evidence for the clinical effectiveness of this nascent approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoroughly annotated data resources are a key requirement in phenotype dependent analysis and diagnosis of diseases in the area of precision medicine. Recent work has shown that curation and systematic annotation of human phenome data can significantly improve the quality and selectivity for the interpretation of inherited diseases. We have therefore developed PhenoDis, a comprehensive, manually annotated database providing symptomatic, genetic and imprinting information about rare cardiac diseases.
RESULTS: PhenoDis includes 214 rare cardiac diseases from Orphanet and 94 more from OMIM. For phenotypic characterization of the diseases, we performed manual annotation of diseases with articles from the biomedical literature. Detailed description of disease symptoms required the use of 2247 different terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Diseases listed in PhenoDis frequently cover a broad spectrum of symptoms with 28\% from the branch of 'cardiovascular abnormality' and others from areas such as neurological (11.5\%) and metabolism (6\%). We collected extensive information on the frequency of symptoms in respective diseases as well as on disease-associated genes and imprinting data. The analysis of the abundance of symptoms in patient studies revealed that most of the annotated symptoms (71\%) are found in less than half of the patients of a particular disease. Comprehensive and systematic characterization of symptoms including their frequency is a pivotal prerequisite for computer based prediction of diseases and disease causing genetic variants. To this end, PhenoDis provides in-depth annotation for a complete group of rare diseases, including information on pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic variants for 206 diseases as listed in ClinVar. We integrated all results in an online database ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenodis/ ) with multiple search options and provide the complete dataset for download.
CONCLUSION: PhenoDis provides a comprehensive set of manually annotated rare cardiac diseases that enables computational approaches for disease prediction via decision support systems and phenotype-driven strategies for the identification of disease causing genes.},

  abstract = {Objective
Physicians classify patients into those with or without a specific disease. Furthermore, there is often interest in classifying patients according to disease etiology or subtype. Classification trees are frequently used to classify patients according to the presence or absence of a disease. However, classification trees can suffer from limited accuracy. In the data-mining and machine-learning literature, alternate classification schemes have been developed. These include bootstrap aggregation (bagging), boosting, random forests, and support vector machines.
Study Design and Setting
We compared the performance of these classification methods with that of conventional classification trees to classify patients with heart failure (HF) according to the following subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction. We also compared the ability of these methods to predict the probability of the presence of HFPEF with that of conventional logistic regression.
Results
We found that modern, flexible tree-based methods from the data-mining literature offer substantial improvement in prediction and classification of HF subtype compared with conventional classification and regression trees. However, conventional logistic regression had superior performance for predicting the probability of the presence of HFPEF compared with the methods proposed in the data-mining literature.
Conclusion
The use of tree-based methods offers superior performance over conventional classification and regression trees for predicting and classifying HF subtypes in a population-based sample of patients from Ontario, Canada. However, these methods do not offer substantial improvements over logistic regression for predicting the presence of HFPEF.},

Genetic predisposition as well as the environment and lifestyle are thought to contribute to disease risk. It is likely that non-linear and complex interactions occur between these multiple factors, involving simultaneous pathological changes in diverse cell types, tissues and organs, at multiple molecular levels. Recent technological advances have exponentially expanded the breadth of available -omics data, from genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome to even the microbiome. Integration of multiple layers of information across several -omics domains, i.e. the so-called multi-omics approach, currently holds the promise as a path towards precision medicine. Indeed, a more meaningful interpretation of genotype-phenotype relationships and the development of successful therapeutics tailored to individual patients are urgently needed. In this review, we will summarize recent findings and applications of integrative multi-omics in elucidating the etiology of CAD/MI; with a special focus on established disease susceptibility loci sequentially identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) over the last ten years. Moreover, in addition to the autosomal genome, we will also consider the genetic variation in our ``second genome'' - the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we will summarize the current challenges in the field and point to future research directions required in order to successfully and effectively apply these approaches for precision medicine.},

These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital.

We argue that a fundamentally narrow and reductionist perspective about the contribution of genes and genetic variants to disease is a key reason `omics' has failed to deliver the anticipated breakthroughs. We then point out the critical utility of key concepts from physiology like homeostasis, regulated systems and redundancy as major intellectual tools to understand how whole animals adapt to the real world. We argue that a lack of fluency in these concepts is a major stumbling block for what has been narrowly defined as `systems biology' by some of its leading advocates. We also point out that it is a failure of regulation at multiple levels that causes many common diseases. Finally, we attempt to integrate our critique of reductionism into a broader social framework about so-called translational research in specific and the root causes of common diseases in general.

Two major criticized things about "omics", or systems biology, are (1) the fact that holistic consideration of living system has long been a foundation of integrative physiology, part of 'traditional biology" but seems to be dis-regarded by reductionist approaches in molecular genetics, and (2) that the hypothesis-neutral approach is not as fruitful as hypothesis-driven studies. Although the cases for (2) are not rigorously cited or demonstrated in the article, there are citations that worth further investigation:

* Pereira \& Weinshilboum 2009; Schroth et al. 2009, for the better outcome of pharmacogenetics thanks to their directed focus on hypothesis-driven studies

* Gibson 2007; Enattah et al. 2008; Ingram et al. 2009, Simonson et al. 2010; Yi et al. 2010, for fruitful research of anthropology seeking answers for specific questions on lactase persistence and genetic adaptations to extreme altitude.

Mentioned an interesting set of principles from integrative physiology: homeostasis, regulated systems and redundancy. For example a homeostatic variable such as body temperature, blood pressure, pH is kept stable around a central point due to redundant regulated systems. If one element fails, the others can pick up the job so that the homeostasis remains.}

  abstract = {Background Clinical interpretation of the large number of rare variants identified by high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies is challenging. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical implications of a HTS strategy for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using a targeted HTS methodology and workflow developed for patients with a range of inherited cardiovascular diseases. By comparing the sequencing results with published findings and with sequence data from a large-scale exome sequencing screen of UK individuals, we sought to quantify the strength of the evidence supporting causality for detected candidate variants.
Methods and results 223 unrelated patients with HCM (46$\pm$15 years at diagnosis, 74\% males) were studied. In order to analyse coding, intronic and regulatory regions of 41 cardiovascular genes, we used solution-based sequence capture followed by massive parallel resequencing on Illumina GAIIx. Average read-depth in the 2.1 Mb target region was 120. Rare (frequency$<$0.5\%) non-synonymous, loss-of-function and splice-site variants were defined as candidates. Excluding titin, we identified 152 distinct candidate variants in sarcomeric or associated genes (89 novel) in 143 patients (64\%). Four sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2) showed an excess of rare single non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in cases compared to controls. The estimated probability that a nsSNP in these genes is pathogenic varied between 57\% and near certainty depending on the location. We detected an additional 94 candidate variants (73 novel) in desmosomal, and ion-channel genes in 96 patients (43\%).
Conclusions This study provides the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the prevalence of sarcomere protein gene variants in patients with HCM using HTS technology. Inclusion of other genes implicated in inherited cardiac disease identifies a large number of non-synonymous rare variants of unknown clinical significance.},

  abstract = {Recent high-throughput efforts such as ENCODE have generated a large body of genome-scale transcriptional data in multiple conditions (e.g., cell-types and disease states). Leveraging these data is especially important for network-based approaches to human disease, for instance to identify coherent transcriptional modules (subnetworks) that can inform functional disease mechanisms and pathological pathways. Yet, genome-scale network analysis across conditions is significantly hampered by the paucity of robust and computationally-efficient methods. Building on the Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for efficient, parameter-free and reproducible identification of network-modules simultaneously across multiple conditions. Our method can accommodate weighted (and unweighted) networks of any size and can similarly use co-expression or raw gene expression input data, without hinging upon the definition and stability of the correlation used to assess gene co-expression. In simulation studies, we demonstrated distinctive advantages of our method over existing methods, which was able to recover accurately both common and condition-specific network-modules without entailing ad-hoc input parameters as required by other approaches. We applied our method to genome-scale and multi-tissue transcriptomic datasets from rats (microarray-based) and humans (mRNA-sequencing-based) and identified several common and tissue-specific subnetworks with functional significance, which were not detected by other methods. In humans we recapitulated the crosstalk between cell-cycle progression and cell-extracellular matrix interactions processes in ventricular zones during neocortex expansion and further, we uncovered pathways related to development of later cognitive functions in the cortical plate of the developing brain which were previously unappreciated. Analyses of seven rat tissues identified a multi-tissue subnetwork of co-expressed heat shock protein (Hsp) and cardiomyopathy genes (Bag3, Cryab, Kras, Emd, Plec), which was significantly replicated using separate failing heart and liver gene expression datasets in humans, thus revealing a conserved functional role for Hsp genes in cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Human cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) frequently have a genetic contribution. Through the application of novel technologies such as next generation sequencing, DNA sequence variants associated with CVMs are being identified at a rapid pace. While clinicians are now able to offer testing with next generation sequencing gene panels or whole exome sequencing to any patient with a CVM, the interpretation of genetic variation remains problematic. Variable phenotypic expression, reduced penetrance, inconsistent phenotyping methods, and the lack of high throughput functional testing of variants, contribute to these challenges. This article elaborates critical issues that impact the decision to broadly implement clinical molecular genetic testing in CVMs. Major benefits of testing include establishing a genetic diagnosis, facilitating cost-effective screening of family members who may have subclinical disease, predicting recurrence risk in offspring, enabling early diagnosis and anticipatory management of CV and non-CV disease phenotypes, predicting long term outcomes, and facilitating the development of novel therapies aimed at disease improvement or prevention. Limitations include financial cost, psychosocial cost, and ambiguity of interpretation of results. Multiplex families and patients with syndromic features are two groups where disease causation could potentially be firmly established. However, these account for the minority of the overall CVM population, and there is increasing recognition that genotypes previously associated with syndromes also exist in patients who lack non-CV findings. In all circumstances, ongoing dialogue between cardiologists and clinical geneticists will be needed to accurately interpret genetic testing and improve these patients' health. This may be most effectively implemented by the creation and support of CV genetics services at centers committed to pursuing testing for patients.},

Dewey et al. found that $\sim$3.5\% of individuals in their cohort had clinically actionable genetic variants. Many of these variants affected blood lipid levels that could influence cardiovascular health. Abul-Husn et al. extended these findings to investigate the genetics and treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, within their patient pool.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONLarge-scale genetic studies of integrated health care populations, with phenotypic data captured natively in the documentation of clinical care, have the potential to unveil genetic associations that point the way to new biology and therapeutic targets. This setting also represents an ideal test bed for the implementation of genomics in routine clinical care in service of precision medicine.
RATIONALEThe DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System aims to catalyze genomic discovery and precision medicine by coupling high-throughput exome sequencing to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of participants in Geisinger's MyCode Community Health Initiative. Here, we describe initial insights from whole-exome sequencing of 50,726 adult participants of predominantly European ancestry using clinical phenotypes derived from EHRs.
RESULTSThe median duration of EHR data associated with sequenced participants was 14 years, with a median of 87 clinical encounters, 687 laboratory tests, and seven procedures per participant. Forty-eight percent of sequenced individuals had one or more first- or second-degree relatives in the sample, and genome-wide autozygosity was similar to other outbred European populations. We found \textasciitilde{}4.2 million single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which \textasciitilde{}176,000 are predicted to result in loss of gene function (LoF). The overwhelming majority of these genetic variants occurred at a minor allele frequency of $\leq$1\%, and more than half were singletons. Each participant harbored a median of 21 rare predicted LoFs. At this sample size, \textasciitilde{}92\% of sequenced genes, including genes that encode existing drug targets or confer risk for highly penetrant genetic diseases, harbor rare heterozygous predicted LoF variants. About 7\% of sequenced genes contained rare homozygous predicted LoF variants in at least one individual. Linking these data to EHR-derived laboratory phenotypes revealed consequences of partial or complete LoF in humans. Among these were previously unidentified associations between predicted LoFs in CSF2RB and basophil and eosinophil counts, and EGLN1-associated erythrocytosis segregating in genetically identified family networks. Using predicted LoFs as a model for drug target antagonism, we found associations supporting the majority of therapeutic targets for lipid lowering. To highlight the opportunity for genotype-phenotype association discovery, we performed exome-wide association analyses of EHR-derived lipid values, newly implicating rare predicted LoFs, and deleterious missense variants in G6PC in association with triglyceride levels. In a survey of 76 clinically actionable disease-associated genes, we estimated that 3.5\% of individuals harbor pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that meet criteria for clinical action. Review of the EHR uncovered findings associated with the monogenic condition in \textasciitilde{}65\% of pathogenic variant carriers' medical records.
CONCLUSIONThe findings reported here demonstrate the value of large-scale sequencing in an integrated health system population, add to the knowledge base regarding the phenotypic consequences of human genetic variation, and illustrate the challenges and promise of genomic medicine implementation. DiscovEHR provides a blueprint for large-scale precision medicine initiatives and genomics-guided therapeutic target discovery. $<$img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/354/6319/aaf6814/F1.medium.gif"/$>$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Therapeutic target validation and genomic medicine in DiscovEHR.(A) Associations between predicted LoF variants in lipid drug target genes and lipid levels.

The DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System couples high-throughput sequencing to an integrated health care system using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). We sequenced the exomes of 50,726 adult participants in the DiscovEHR study to identify \textasciitilde{}4.2 million rare single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which \textasciitilde{}176,000 are predicted to result in a loss of gene function. Linking these data to EHR-derived clinical phenotypes, we find clinical associations supporting therapeutic targets, including genes encoding drug targets for lipid lowering, and identify previously unidentified rare alleles associated with lipid levels and other blood level traits. About 3.5\% of individuals harbor deleterious variants in 76 clinically actionable genes. The DiscovEHR data set provides a blueprint for large-scale precision medicine initiatives and genomics-guided therapeutic discovery.

\item Table 1. Criteria for defining a variant as pathogenic

\item Predicting pathogenicity has low specificity (?), limited accuracy (65-80\%), even with in silico algorithms that use protein structural changes, evolutionary conservation, protein function, altered splicing.

\item 60 - 90\% of rare cardiomyopathy mutations are "private", i.e. found only in single families.

\item Identical mutations in separate families have been found to be recent and independent mutational events

\end{itemize}

Compiled knowledge on genetic cardiomyophathies:

\begin{itemize}

\item hypertrophic (HCM)

\item storage and metabolic

\item restrictive

\item dilated

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)}

\begin{itemize}

\item is monogenic disorder

\item Pathogenic mutations have been established in 8 genes: MYH7, TPM1, TNNT2, MYCPC3, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, ACTC1.

\item Likely pathogenic mutations found in other 15 genes

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)}

\begin{itemize}

\item most common cause for heart transplantation

\item 16 definitive disease causing genes, 41 putative disease causing genes

\item [NOTE] (As of 2018/09/17) GWAS presents 44 associations with 69 genes (???) while Ensembl reports 52 associated genes (with DCM, dominant and DCM, recessive) -- Not sure how these numbers relate (GWAS maps phenotypes to EFO, ontology used in Ensembl is not clear)

This has led to the important and hotly debated issue of where the 'missing heritability' of complex diseases might be found. Here, seven leading geneticists offer their opinion about where this heritability is likely to lie, what this could tell us about the underlying genetic architecture of common diseases and how this could inform research strategies for uncovering genetic risk factors.},

Gives different perspective on the possible directions to approach the problem of missing heritability

\begin{itemize}

\item structural variation: deletion/duplication/insertion (on a large region of the genome), copy number polymorphism. CNPs are repetitive, thus challenging to study with the current genoyping and sequencing technologies.

\item rare variants are rare individually but "collectively frequent", refined methods are needed to test for associations of the phenotypes and these variants

\item GWAS have been placing too much importance on genetics and cannot measure environmental interaction (GxE) in determining a phenotype

\item [Trang agrees with this one the most] Phenotypic variations cannot be explained by adding genetic effects, because of epistasis: the effect of one genes are modified by another. Genetic variations interact at different layers of genomic complexity: RNA, miRNA, protein-protein, protein-DNA, etc. Need to approach this problem with the systems biology framework which model the interaction of the systems

\item Transgenerational genetic effects: phenotypic variation in a generation result from genetic ones in previous generations, another word for epigenetics which involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, inheritance and activity of RNA and proteins of the ascendant in the gametes.

Despite some remarkable insights from functional genomics, the incorporation of new profiling technologies into the clinical arena has been slow, largely because of appropriate concerns regarding the need for robust validation through prospective approaches. It is difficult to see how traditional study designs can be appropriately scaled. Full exploitation of these approaches will require building investigative platforms that allow the study of integrative biology in large populations and in multiple different disease states.

Despite tremendous research and clinical efforts, the molecular causes remain unknown for nearly half of the patients, due to genetic heterogeneity and conventional molecular diagnosis based on a gene-by-gene approach. We aimed to test next generation sequencing (NGS) as an efficient and cost-effective strategy to accelerate patient diagnosis. We designed a capture library to target the coding and splice site sequences of all known NMD genes and used NGS and DNA multiplexing to retrieve the pathogenic mutations in patients with heterogeneous NMD with or without known mutations. We retrieved all known mutations, including point mutations and small indels, intronic and exonic mutations, and a large deletion in a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, validating the sensitivity and reproducibility of this strategy on a heterogeneous subset of NMD with different genetic inheritance. Most pathogenic mutations were ranked on top in our blind bioinformatic pipeline. Following the same strategy, we characterized probable TTN, RYR1 and COL6A3 mutations in several patients without previous molecular diagnosis. The cost was less than conventional testing for a single large gene. With appropriate adaptations, this strategy could be implemented into a routine genetic diagnosis set-up as a first screening approach to detect most kind of mutations, potentially before the need of more invasive and specific clinical investigations. An earlier genetic diagnosis should provide improved disease management and higher quality genetic counseling, and ease access to therapy or inclusion into therapeutic trials.},

For the past decade, a lineage map for the distinct subsets of progenitors that generate the embryonic mammalian heart has begun to lay a foundation for the development of new strategies for rebuilding the adult heart after injury, an unmet clinical need for the vast majority of patients with end-stage heart failure who are not heart transplant recipients. The studies also have implications for the root causes of congenital heart disease, which affects 1 in 50 live births, the most prevalent malformations in children. Although much of this insight has been generated in murine models, it is becoming increasingly clear that there can be important divergence with principles and pathways for human cardiogenesis, as well as for regenerative pathways. The development of human stem cell models, coupled with recent advances in genome editing with RNA-guided endonucleases, offers a new approach for the primary study of human cardiogenesis. In addition, application of the technology to the in vivo setting in large animal models, including nonhuman primates, has opened the door to genome-edited large animal models of adult and congenital heart disease, as well as a detailed mechanistic dissection of the more diverse and complex set of progenitor families and pathways, which guide human cardiogenesis. Implications of this new technology for a new generation of human-based, genetically tractable systems are discussed, along with potential therapeutic applications.},

In the first application, DNA sequence variants that have been found to be associated with cardiovascular disease may be incorporated in risk-prediction algorithms to more accurately forecast whether patients will develop disease. In the second application, known as pharmacogenomics, DNA sequence variants that have been found to be associated with either beneficial effects or adverse effects of a medication may be used to help decide which medications or dosages of medications to prescribe to patients.

  abstract = {Purpose: Next-generation sequencing has transformed genetic research and is poised to revolutionize clinical diagnosis. However, the vast amount of data and inevitable discovery of incidental findings require novel analytic approaches. We therefore implemented for the first time a strategy that utilizes an a priori structured framework and a conservative threshold for selecting clinically relevant incidental findings. Methods: We categorized 2,016 genes linked with Mendelian diseases into "bins" based on clinical utility and validity and used a computational algorithm to analyze 80 whole-genome sequences in order to explore the use of such an approach in a simulated real-world setting. Results: The algorithm effectively reduced the number of variants requiring human review and identified incidental variants with likely clinical relevance. Incorporation of the Human Gene Mutation Database improved the yield for missense mutations but also revealed that a substantial proportion of purported disease-causing mutations were misleading. Conclusion: This approach is adaptable to any clinically relevant bin structure, scalable to the demands of a clinical laboratory work-flow, and flexible with respect to advances in genomics. We anticipate that application of this strategy will facilitate pretest informed consent, laboratory analysis, and posttest return of results in a clinical context. Genet Med 2013:15(1):36-44},

1. Identification of disease genes within associated loci. For example, chromosomal loci associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, artherosclerosis, etc. are found, but genes were not identified.

2. Risk stratification. For example hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with mutations in multiple genes, but those in MYBPC3 are linked with higher death risk than those in MYH7.

3. More specific genetic-based classification of disease types

4. Pharmacogenomics help to individualize treatment for better response or to predict side effects.

An interesting example given in this article is Lamin A/C (encoded by the gene LMNA). Mutations in this gene have been found to link with various and seemingly unrelated disorders. The list of disorders have grown much longer since this publication. According to the GHR (Genetic Home Reference, NIH), there are now at least 11 disorders associated with mutations in LMNA. Many of them have unknown molecular basis. Although in this paper, this wide range of impact was attributed to the gene product having "multiple functions" it is more precise to state that such diverse impact is due to the variety of modifications (post-transcriptional and post-translational) as well as its binding partners in each organ and tissues.

Trang's thinking maybe LMNA can serve as an interesting example for how existing data can shed new lights if queried the right way.}

Currently, the expression of 10-15|X\% of human genes can be analysed simultaneously in a single experiment using cDNA or oligonucleotide-based format of DNA array. Alternatively, smaller DNA arrays with a limited number of selected genes, such as cytokines, growth factors or transcription factors, can be used. In concordance with Human Genome Project, after a few years, the DNA arrays will allow the analysis of expression of the whole human genome and will have a great impact on basic research, drug development and diagnostics. It is important to characterise mechanisms of atherosclerosis-related diseases at the level of gene expression so that new therapeutic strategies can be identified. With the aid of DNA array it is possible to identify multiple, simultaneous, transcriptional events that ameliorate or contribute to atherogenesis. The results are non-physical maps of the function, hierarchy and interactions of genetic programs.

Crowdsourcing task: participants were asked to

1. identify GEO studies belonging to 1 of these types

* single-gene perturbation on mammalian cells

* single-drug perturbation on mammalian cells

* normal vs diseased tissues

2. extract metadata from the studies

3. compute differential expression using GEO2Enrichr (chrome extension)

Although not stated explicitly, it seemed the selected data sets are limited to microarray assays, so they can be processed uniformly (batch correction, then DEG calling).

Signatures were then sanitized by automated filters and manual inspection.

\subsection{Trang:}

1. From the manuscript, it sounds they have created a large data sets with quality annotation. The design of the microtask is a decent idea. However, the web app is disappointing. Given a query for "signature", for example "myocardial infarction", it will result in a list of signatures, each associated with a single GSE id, having their own list of up- and down-regulated genes. These lists do not seem to have resulted from an integrative analysis as described in the manuscript.

The list of up- and down-regulated genes are available upon clicking on the ‘Enrichr‘ icon. There are numerous design problems on this part, and in the Enrichr links that they lead to. On the Enrichr interface, multiple sources of other experiments are presented, each showing the top genes overlapping with the gene set under investigation. It takes some time to figure out what they're showing, and these plots do not give much insight, because very different types of assays are included here (for example ENCODE Histone modification, Co-expression with some specific TFs, etc.).

2. This platform gives me an idea on organizing GEO data sets. A critical requirement for exact retrieval is the consistency of data annotations. GEO has little requirement on standardizing data annotations, resulting in loosely structured metadata. For GEO to be exploited properly and effectively, it can be curated with controlled vocabulary, like ENCODE. These tasks may be designed for crowd-sourcing and/or scaled up with machine learning. There have been many ontologies developed for such purposes in biological research, for example the assay types (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) can be annotated with OBI, UBERON for tissue sites, the biological sources can be annotated with CL for primary cell lines, etc.}

Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as to how the genetic pathways that regulate aging in model organisms influence cardiovascular aging. Likewise, in the molecular biology of aging field, few studies fully assess the role of these aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and their roles regulating cardiovascular health. We then discuss a series of review articles that will appear in succession and provide a more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.bja.2018.05.060},
  abstract = {Background
The link between exposure to general anaesthesia and surgery (exposure) and cognitive decline in older adults is debated. We hypothesised that it is associated with cognitive decline.
Methods
We analysed the longitudinal cognitive function trajectory in a cohort of older adults. Models assessed the rate of change in cognition over time, and its association with exposure to anaesthesia and surgery. Analyses assessed whether exposure in the 20 yr before enrolment is associated with cognitive decline when compared with those unexposed, and whether post-enrolment exposure is associated with a change in cognition in those unexposed before enrolment.
Results
We included 1819 subjects with median (25th and 75th percentiles) follow-up of 5.1 (2.7\textendash{}7.6) yr and 4 (3\textendash{}6) cognitive assessments. Exposure in the previous 20 yr was associated with a greater negative slope compared with not exposed (slope: \textendash{}0.077 vs \textendash{}0.059; difference: \textendash{}0.018; 95\% confidence interval: \textendash{}0.032, \textendash{}0.003; P=0.015). Post-enrolment exposure in those previously unexposed was associated with a change in slope after exposure (slope: \textendash{}0.100 vs \textendash{}0.059 for post-exposure vs pre-exposure, respectively; difference: \textendash{}0.041; 95\% confidence interval: \textendash{}0.074, \textendash{}0.008; P=0.016). Cognitive impairment could be attributed to declines in memory and attention/executive cognitive domains.
Conclusions
In older adults, exposure to general anaesthesia and surgery was associated with a subtle decline in cognitive z-scores. For an individual with no prior exposure and with exposure after enrolment, the decline in cognitive function over a 5 yr period after the exposure would be 0.2 standard deviations more than the expected decline as a result of ageing. This small cognitive decline could be meaningful for individuals with already low baseline cognition.},

GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4), NK2 transcription factor-related, locus 5 (NKX2-5), T-box 5 (TBX5), serum response factor (SRF), and myocyte-enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), here referred to as ``cardiac TFs,'' have been hypothesized to collaborate to direct cardiac gene expression. Using a modified ChIP-seq procedure, we defined chromatin occupancy by these TFs and p300 genome wide and provided unbiased support for this hypothesis. We used this principle to show that co-occupancy of a chromatin region by multiple TFs can be used to identify cardiac enhancers. Of 13 such regions tested in transient transgenic embryos, seven (54\%) drove cardiac gene expression. Among these regions were three cardiac-specific enhancers of Gata4, Srf, and swItch/sucrose nonfermentable-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 3 (Smarcd3), an epigenetic regulator of cardiac gene expression. Multiple cardiac TFs and p300-bound regions were associated with cardiac-enriched genes and with functional annotations related to heart development. Importantly, the large majority (1,375/1,715) of loci bound by multiple cardiac TFs did not overlap loci bound by p300. Our data identify thousands of prospective cardiac regulatory sequences and indicate that multiple TF co-occupancy of a genomic region identifies developmentally relevant enhancers that are largely distinct from p300-associated enhancers.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease.
Methods
We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1$\cdot$25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371.
Findings
During 5$\cdot$2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83\hphantom{,}098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90\textendash{}114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60\textendash{}74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1$\cdot$44 [95\% CI 1$\cdot$32\textendash{}1$\cdot$58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1$\cdot$43 [1$\cdot$25\textendash{}1$\cdot$63]), and stable angina (1$\cdot$41 [1$\cdot$36\textendash{}1$\cdot$46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1$\cdot$08 [1$\cdot$00\textendash{}1$\cdot$17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0$\cdot$91 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$86\textendash{}0$\cdot$98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1$\cdot$23 [1$\cdot$20\textendash{}1$\cdot$27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure $\geq$140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63$\cdot$3\% (95\% CI 62$\cdot$9\textendash{}63$\cdot$8) compared with 46$\cdot$1\% (45$\cdot$5\textendash{}46$\cdot$8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5$\cdot$0 years earlier (95\% CI 4$\cdot$8\textendash{}5$\cdot$2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years.
Interpretation
The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND For more than a decade, risk stratification for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been enhanced by targeted genetic testing. Using sequencing results, clinicians routinely assess the risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a patient's relatives and diagnose the condition in patients who have ambiguous clinical presentations. However, the benefits of genetic testing come with the risk that variants may be misclassified.
METHODS Using publicly accessible exome data, we identified variants that have previously been considered causal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that are overrepresented in the general population. We studied these variants in diverse populations and reevaluated their initial ascertainments in the medical literature. We reviewed patient records at a leading genetic-testing laboratory for occurrences of these variants during the near-decade-long history of the laboratory.
RESULTS Multiple patients, all of whom were of African or unspecified ancestry, received positive reports, with variants misclassified as pathogenic on the basis of the understanding at the time of testing. Subsequently, all reported variants were recategorized as benign. The mutations that were most common in the general population were significantly more common among black Americans than among white Americans (P$<$0.001). Simulations showed that the inclusion of even small numbers of black Americans in control cohorts probably would have prevented these misclassifications. We identified methodologic shortcomings that contributed to these errors in the medical literature.

CONCLUSIONS The misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic that we found in our study shows the need for sequencing the genomes of diverse populations, both in asymptomatic controls and the tested patient population. These results expand on current guidelines, which recommend the use of ancestry-matched controls to interpret variants. As additional populations of different ancestry backgrounds are sequenced, we expect variant reclassifications to increase, particularly for ancestry groups that have historically been less well studied.

We wanted to test the hypothesis that short telomeres are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease using a Mendelian randomization approach free of reverse causation and of most confounding.
METHODS: We genotyped 3 genetic variants in OBFC1 (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold containing 1), TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), and TERC (telomerase RNA component), which code for proteins and RNA involved in telomere maintenance. We studied 105 055 individuals from Copenhagen; 17 235 of these individuals were diagnosed with ischemic heart disease between 1977 and 2013, and 66 618 had telomere length measured. For genetic studies, we further included the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM) consortium dataset, which included up to 184 967 participants and 60 837 cases of ischemic heart disease. We conducted multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard models for observational estimates, using logistic and instrumental variable analysis for genetic estimates.
RESULTS: Observationally, a 200-bp\textendash{}shorter telomere length was associated with a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for ischemic heart disease of 1.02 (95\% CI, 1.01\textendash{}1.03). Per allele, telomeres were shorter by 67 bp (73\textendash{}60). In meta-analyses of all 4 studies combined, odds ratios for ischemic heart disease were 1.05 (1.03\textendash{}1.08) for OBCF1, 1.04 (1.02\textendash{}1.06) for TERT, and 1.01 (0.99\textendash{}1.03) for TERC. A genetically determined 200-bp\textendash{}shorter telomere length was associated with an odds ratio for ischemic heart disease of 1.10 (1.06\textendash{}1.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Shorter telomeres were associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease, both observationally and genetically.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.
Methods
For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.
Findings
We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19$\cdot$1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127$\cdot$0 mm Hg (95\% credible interval 125$\cdot$7\textendash{}128$\cdot$3) in men and 122$\cdot$3 mm Hg (121$\cdot$0\textendash{}123$\cdot$6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78$\cdot$7 mm Hg (77$\cdot$9\textendash{}79$\cdot$5) for men and 76$\cdot$7 mm Hg (75$\cdot$9\textendash{}77$\cdot$6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24$\cdot$1\% (21$\cdot$4\textendash{}27$\cdot$1) in men and 20$\cdot$1\% (17$\cdot$8\textendash{}22$\cdot$5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1$\cdot$13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence.
Interpretation
During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

  abstract = {Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to 53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4). Genetic risk scores account for 0.9 to 2.6\% of the HRV variance. Significant genetic correlation is found for HRV with heart rate (-0.74$<$rg$<$-0.55) and blood pressure (-0.35$<$rg$<$-0.20). These findings provide clinically relevant biological insight into heritable variation in vagal heart rhythm regulation, with a key role for genetic variants (GNG11, RGS6) that influence G-protein heterotrimer action in GIRK-channel induced pacemaker membrane hyperpolarization.},

  abstract = {Personal data for 108 individuals were collected during a 9-month period, including whole genome sequences; clinical tests, metabolomes, proteomes, and microbiomes at three time points; and daily activity tracking. Using all of these data, we generated a correlation network that revealed communities of related analytes associated with physiology and disease. Connectivity within analyte communities enabled the identification of known and candidate biomarkers (e.g., gamma-glutamyltyrosine was densely interconnected with clinical analytes for cardiometabolic disease). We calculated polygenic scores from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 127 traits and diseases, and used these to discover molecular correlates of polygenic risk (e.g., genetic risk for inflammatory bowel disease was negatively correlated with plasma cystine). Finally, behavioral coaching informed by personal data helped participants to improve clinical biomarkers. Our results show that measurement of personal data clouds over time can improve our understanding of health and disease, including early transitions to disease states.},

While traditional investigations of the genetic basis of complex diseases assume homogeneity across individuals and identify genes differentially expressed between a diseased and a healthy population, Northeastern University and University of California Los Angeles researchers have identified a different class of disease genes that exhibit heterogeneous up and down-regulation across 100 genetically distinct mouse strains subject to a stressor inducing heart failure, but show no significant change of expression at the population level. The results, validated by in vitro knockdown, demonstrate that individualized approaches are crucial to unmask all genes involved in complex diseases, opening new avenues for the development of personalized therapies.},

However, dronedarone might be harmful in patients with recent decompensated heart failure and increases mortality in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. A pathophysiological explanation for these discrepant data is lacking. This study investigated the effects of dronedarone on gene and protein expression in the infarcted area and border zone in pigs subjected to anterior ischemia/reperfusion myocardial infarction. The ischemia/reperfusion myocardial infarction was induced in 16 pigs. Eight pigs were treated with dronedarone for 28 days after myocardial infarction, the remaining pigs served as control. Microarray-based transcriptome profiling and 2D-DIGE-based proteome analysis were used to assess the effects of dronedarone on left ventricular gene expression in healthy (LV), infarcted (MI), and border zone tissue. Selected targets were validated by RT-qPCR or immunoblot analyses, with special emphasize given to the transcriptome/proteome overlap. Combined ``omics'' analysis was performed to identify most significant disease and function charts affected by dronedarone and to establish an integrated network. The levels of 879 (BZ) or 7 (MI) transcripts and 51 (LV) or 15 (BZ) proteins were significantly altered by dronedarone, pointing to a substantial efficacy of dronedarone in the border zone. Transcriptome and proteome data indicate that dronedarone influences post-infarction remodeling processes and identify matricellular proteins as major targets of dronedarone in this setting. This finding is fully supported by the disease and function charts as well as by the integrated network established by combined ``omics''. Dronedarone therapy alters myocardial gene expression after acute myocardial infarction with pronounced effects in the border zone. Dronedarone promotes infarct healing via regulation of periostin and might contribute to the limitation of its expansion as well as cardiac rupture. Thus, there are no experimental hints that dronedarone per se has direct harmful effects after MI in ventricular tissue.},

This work reported systematic evaluation of rare variations in selected cardiomyopathy diseases (HCM, DCM, ARVC), giving extensive examples of variants for which rareness and pathogenicity do not correlate.

\subsubsection{Method}

\subsubsubsection{Measure of variant}

\begin{itemize}

\item F\_V (Frequency of variant V) = (\# V-carriers) / (\# samples)

\item Case excess = (F\_V in clinical cohorts) - (F\_V in ExAC)

\item OR (Odd Ratio) = odds of CM given variant / odds of CM without variant

\item EF (Etiological fraction) = proportion of cases in which the variant is causal

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Measure of gene}

\begin{itemize}

\item OR with confidence interval

\item (Table S6) Predicted pathogenic = Number of cases predicted to be pathogenic if carrying variants in gene X

\item (Table S6) Reported pathogenic: Number of cases where variants in gene X are pathogenic in the clinical cohorts.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results}

~

\subsection{Notes}

There seems to be a assumption popular in the field prior to this work but not explicitly stated in the paper: rareness is necessary for defining pathogenictiy. Although this notion is directly challenged in this paper, it is not quite reasonable to completely abolish the relation (!rare =$>$ !penetrant), but rather define rare in a context.

Also as put forth in the paper, variants should also be interpreted separately for each class (protein altering, truncating, non-truncating, etc.), and in the light of disease mechanisms (what the gene does, how the variant in question is affecting that function, etc).}

  abstract = {Disclaimer: These ACMG Standards and Guidelines were developed primarily as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory services. Adherence to these standards and guidelines is voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These Standards and Guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinical laboratory geneticist should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinical laboratory geneticists are encouraged to document in the patient's record the rationale for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with these Standards and Guidelines. They also are advised to take notice of the date any particular guideline was adopted and to consider other relevant medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants.1 In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology\textemdash{}``pathogenic,'' ``likely pathogenic,'' ``uncertain significance,'' ``likely benign,'' and ``benign''\textemdash{}to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\textendash{}approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.Genet Med 17 5, 405\textendash{}423.},

Of eight different mutations, four were present in single families, while four occurred in two or more families. To investigate the origins of the four shared mutations, we defined the beta cardiac MHC haplotypes of each of the mutation-bearing chromosomes by determining the alleles present at three intragenic polymorphic loci. Two of the mutations (Arg453Cys and Val606Met) have arisen independently in each of three families, being found on different chromosomal backgrounds. A third mutation (Gly584Arg) is associated with identical haplotypes in two families with Portuguese ancestors, suggesting a founder effect. Haplotype analysis was uninformative for the fourth mutation (Arg403Gln). Thus, FHC-causing mutations have arisen independently in at least 12 of the 14 families studied, suggesting that the majority have arisen relatively recently as new mutations. This finding predicts the prevalence of disease-causing beta cardiac MHC mutations to be comparable in all population groups.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of thousands of loci for hundreds of phenotypes. However, the issue of missing heritability remains unsolved for most complex traits. Locus discovery could be enhanced with both improved power through multi-phenotype analysis (MPA) and use of a wider allele frequency range, including rare variants (RVs). MPA methods for single-variant association have been proposed, but given their low power for RVs, more efficient approaches are required. We propose multi-phenotype analysis of rare variants (MARV), a burden test-based method for RVs extended to the joint analysis of multiple phenotypes through a powerful reverse regression technique. Specifically, MARV models the proportion of RVs at which minor alleles are carried by individuals within a genomic region as a linear combination of multiple phenotypes, which can be both binary and continuous, and the method accommodates directly the genotyped and imputed data. The full model, including all phenotypes, is tested for association for discovery, and a more thorough dissection of the phenotype combinations for any set of RVs is also enabled. We show, via simulations, that the type I error rate is well controlled under various correlations between two continuous phenotypes, and that the method outperforms a univariate burden test in all considered scenarios. Application of MARV to 4876 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 for triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols highlights known loci with stronger signals of association than those observed in univariate RV analyses and suggests novel RV effects for these lipid traits.},

Additionally, we investigated ethnic diversity by characterizing 979 SNPs distributed throughout the genome. Our algorithm could spare 60\% of SNPs required for genotyping and limit the imprecision in allele-frequency estimation of nontag SNPs to 2\% on average. We discovered the presence of a mosaic pattern of LD plots within a conventionally inferred haplotype block. This emerged because multiple groups of SNPs with strong intragroup LD were mingled in their physical positions. The pattern of LD plots showed some similarity, but the details of tag SNPs were not entirely concordant among three populations. Consequently, our algorithm utilizing LD grouping allows selection of a more faithful set of tag SNPs than do previous algorithms utilizing haplotype blocks.},

These approaches typically examine whether a group of related genes in the same functional pathway are jointly associated with a trait of interest.

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the use of biological knowledge to supplement statistical analysis in identifying genes associated with disease. It has been previously found that the 402H variant in complement factor H (CFH) is associated with risk for developing age related macular degeneration (AMD). By focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement pathway, we were able to use the genotype data from a recently published AMD genome wide association study to identify two additional genes, C7 and MBL2, as potentially associated with subtypes of AMD. Two SNPs situated in introns of C7 and MBL2 could help differentiate between two forms of AMD: wet (more severe form of AMD) and dry (milder form of AMD). We identified a C7 haplotype associated with protection against developing wet AMD among individuals with homozygous CFH risk allele 402H (p-value 0.001 for wet AMD versus dry AMD, odds ratio (OR) 0.16, OR 95\% CI 0.05\textendash{}0.49) as well as among individuals with at least one CFH risk allele (p-value 0.007 for wet AMD versus dry AMD, OR 0.35, OR 95\% CI 0.16\textendash{}0.77). The fact that the statistical scores for the C7 and MBL2 SNPs were significant (low false discovery rate) at the pathway level, but not significant at the genome level suggests that focusing at the pathway level can be beneficial for identifying SNP signals that would be lost at the genome-wide level.

A key aspect of genomic medicine is to make individualized clinical decisions from personal genomes. We developed a machine-learning framework to integrate personal genomes and electronic health record (EHR) data and used this framework to study abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a prevalent irreversible cardiovascular disease with unclear etiology. Performing whole-genome sequencing on AAA patients and controls, we demonstrated its predictive precision solely from personal genomes. By modeling personal genomes with EHRs, this framework quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of adjusting personal lifestyles given personal genome baselines, demonstrating its utility as a personal health management tool. We showed that this new framework agnostically identified genetic components involved in AAA, which were subsequently validated in human aortic tissues and in murine models. Our study presents a new framework for disease genome analysis, which can be used for both health management and understanding the biological architecture of complex diseases.

In this paper, whole genome sequences of patients with abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) and healthy controls are combined with electronic health records (EHRs) in order to predict which individuals are at risk for AAA. The authors find that genomic factors and EHRs both contribute information about AAA risk, and that analyzing genetic risk relative to particular lifestyle-associated covariates suggests that some patients could reduce their AAA risk with simple lifestyle changes. Analysis of AAA risk predictive genes in the context of biological networks further identifies functional modules that provide insight into mechanisms of AAA development.

This work simultaneously models AAA risk and mechanism, setting a new precedent for future studies. I particularly liked the analysis of how changes to clinical risk factors impacted predictions of patient outcome for patients with different levels of genetic risk, which illustrates how these factors can be combined in clinical practice to identify patients that could benefit from lifestyle changes.

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate the integration of different layers of data and application of Machine Learning toward improving understanding of disease and improving care.

\item AAA provides an example of complex disease where GWAS can hardly agree on a few risk loci. A review paper was cited (Bradley et al. 2016) - should check this one out.

Human health is dependent upon environmental exposures, yet the diversity and variation in exposures are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890~days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region.~Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health.},

Wearable device designed to capture biotic and abiotic exposure within 2 meter of the participants.

\begin{itemize}

\item Abiotic airbone particles were collected and measured in real time using RTI MicroPEM

\item Biotic samples were collected by the filters before moving to MicroPEM unit

\item Each sampling and monitoring periodlasting for 1-14 days. At the end of such period, filters and cartridges were removed and stored at -80oC. For biotic samples, DNA and RNA were extracted and libraries were prepared for next-gen sequencing.

\end{itemize}

Each sample gave a median of 62.2M (DNA) and 45.8M (RNA) paired-end reads. In total, the data set has 43B DNA and 30B RNA reads. The study covered 15 individuals, sampled over the period of 890 days.

The average DNA methylation level among a group of cells has been extensively documented.

Here we established a gold standard of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in DNA methylation based on single-cell bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) data. With that, we optimized a computational pipeline for estimating the heterogeneity in DNA methylation from bulk BS-seq data. We further built HeteroMeth, a database for searching, browsing, visualizing, and downloading the data for heterogeneity in DNA methylation for a total of 141 samples in humans, mice, Arabidopsis, and rice. Three genes are used as examples to illustrate the power of HeteroMeth in the identification of unique features in DNA methylation.
