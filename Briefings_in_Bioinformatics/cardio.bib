  abstract = {The traditional paradigm of cardiovascular disease research derives insight from large-scale, broadly inclusive clinical studies of well-characterized pathologies. These insights are then put into practice according to standardized clinical guidelines. However, stagnation in the development of new cardiovascular therapies and variability in therapeutic response implies that this paradigm is insufficient for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden. In this state-of-the-art review, we~examine 3 interconnected ideas we put forth as key concepts for enabling a transition to precision cardiology: 1)~precision~characterization of cardiovascular disease with machine learning methods; 2) the application of network models of disease to embrace disease complexity; and 3) using insights from the previous 2 ideas to enable pharmacology and polypharmacology systems for more precise drug-to-patient matching and patient-disease stratification. We conclude by exploring the challenges of applying a precision approach to cardiology, which arise from a deficit of the required resources and infrastructure, and emerging evidence for the clinical effectiveness of this nascent approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoroughly annotated data resources are a key requirement in phenotype dependent analysis and diagnosis of diseases in the area of precision medicine. Recent work has shown that curation and systematic annotation of human phenome data can significantly improve the quality and selectivity for the interpretation of inherited diseases. We have therefore developed PhenoDis, a comprehensive, manually annotated database providing symptomatic, genetic and imprinting information about rare cardiac diseases.
RESULTS: PhenoDis includes 214 rare cardiac diseases from Orphanet and 94 more from OMIM. For phenotypic characterization of the diseases, we performed manual annotation of diseases with articles from the biomedical literature. Detailed description of disease symptoms required the use of 2247 different terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Diseases listed in PhenoDis frequently cover a broad spectrum of symptoms with 28\% from the branch of 'cardiovascular abnormality' and others from areas such as neurological (11.5\%) and metabolism (6\%). We collected extensive information on the frequency of symptoms in respective diseases as well as on disease-associated genes and imprinting data. The analysis of the abundance of symptoms in patient studies revealed that most of the annotated symptoms (71\%) are found in less than half of the patients of a particular disease. Comprehensive and systematic characterization of symptoms including their frequency is a pivotal prerequisite for computer based prediction of diseases and disease causing genetic variants. To this end, PhenoDis provides in-depth annotation for a complete group of rare diseases, including information on pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic variants for 206 diseases as listed in ClinVar. We integrated all results in an online database ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenodis/ ) with multiple search options and provide the complete dataset for download.
CONCLUSION: PhenoDis provides a comprehensive set of manually annotated rare cardiac diseases that enables computational approaches for disease prediction via decision support systems and phenotype-driven strategies for the identification of disease causing genes.},

  abstract = {Objective
Physicians classify patients into those with or without a specific disease. Furthermore, there is often interest in classifying patients according to disease etiology or subtype. Classification trees are frequently used to classify patients according to the presence or absence of a disease. However, classification trees can suffer from limited accuracy. In the data-mining and machine-learning literature, alternate classification schemes have been developed. These include bootstrap aggregation (bagging), boosting, random forests, and support vector machines.
Study Design and Setting
We compared the performance of these classification methods with that of conventional classification trees to classify patients with heart failure (HF) according to the following subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction. We also compared the ability of these methods to predict the probability of the presence of HFPEF with that of conventional logistic regression.
Results
We found that modern, flexible tree-based methods from the data-mining literature offer substantial improvement in prediction and classification of HF subtype compared with conventional classification and regression trees. However, conventional logistic regression had superior performance for predicting the probability of the presence of HFPEF compared with the methods proposed in the data-mining literature.
Conclusion
The use of tree-based methods offers superior performance over conventional classification and regression trees for predicting and classifying HF subtypes in a population-based sample of patients from Ontario, Canada. However, these methods do not offer substantial improvements over logistic regression for predicting the presence of HFPEF.},

  abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) remain among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, urgently demanding a better understanding of disease etiology and more efficient therapeutic strategies. Genetic predisposition as well as the environment and lifestyle are thought to contribute to disease risk. It is likely that non-linear and complex interactions occur between these multiple factors, involving simultaneous pathological changes in diverse cell types, tissues and organs, at multiple molecular levels. Recent technological advances have exponentially expanded the breadth of available -omics data, from genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome to even the microbiome. Integration of multiple layers of information across several -omics domains, i.e. the so-called multi-omics approach, currently holds the promise as a path towards precision medicine. Indeed, a more meaningful interpretation of genotype-phenotype relationships and the development of successful therapeutics tailored to individual patients are urgently needed. In this review, we will summarize recent findings and applications of integrative multi-omics in elucidating the etiology of CAD/MI; with a special focus on established disease susceptibility loci sequentially identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) over the last ten years. Moreover, in addition to the autosomal genome, we will also consider the genetic variation in our ``second genome'' - the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we will summarize the current challenges in the field and point to future research directions required in order to successfully and effectively apply these approaches for precision medicine.},

These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.},

We then point out the critical utility of key concepts from physiology like homeostasis, regulated systems and redundancy as major intellectual tools to understand how whole animals adapt to the real world. We argue that a lack of fluency in these concepts is a major stumbling block for what has been narrowly defined as `systems biology' by some of its leading advocates. We also point out that it is a failure of regulation at multiple levels that causes many common diseases. Finally, we attempt to integrate our critique of reductionism into a broader social framework about so-called translational research in specific and the root causes of common diseases in general. Throughout we offer ideas and suggestions that might be incorporated into the current biomedical environment to advance the understanding of disease through the perspective of physiology in conjunction with epidemiology as opposed to bottom-up reductionism alone.},

The aim of this study was to explore the clinical implications of a HTS strategy for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using a targeted HTS methodology and workflow developed for patients with a range of inherited cardiovascular diseases. By comparing the sequencing results with published findings and with sequence data from a large-scale exome sequencing screen of UK individuals, we sought to quantify the strength of the evidence supporting causality for detected candidate variants.
Methods and results 223 unrelated patients with HCM (46$\pm$15 years at diagnosis, 74\% males) were studied. In order to analyse coding, intronic and regulatory regions of 41 cardiovascular genes, we used solution-based sequence capture followed by massive parallel resequencing on Illumina GAIIx. Average read-depth in the 2.1 Mb target region was 120. Rare (frequency$<$0.5\%) non-synonymous, loss-of-function and splice-site variants were defined as candidates. Excluding titin, we identified 152 distinct candidate variants in sarcomeric or associated genes (89 novel) in 143 patients (64\%). Four sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2) showed an excess of rare single non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in cases compared to controls. The estimated probability that a nsSNP in these genes is pathogenic varied between 57\% and near certainty depending on the location. We detected an additional 94 candidate variants (73 novel) in desmosomal, and ion-channel genes in 96 patients (43\%).
Conclusions This study provides the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the prevalence of sarcomere protein gene variants in patients with HCM using HTS technology. Inclusion of other genes implicated in inherited cardiac disease identifies a large number of non-synonymous rare variants of unknown clinical significance.},

  abstract = {Recent high-throughput efforts such as ENCODE have generated a large body of genome-scale transcriptional data in multiple conditions (e.g., cell-types and disease states). Leveraging these data is especially important for network-based approaches to human disease, for instance to identify coherent transcriptional modules (subnetworks) that can inform functional disease mechanisms and pathological pathways. Yet, genome-scale network analysis across conditions is significantly hampered by the paucity of robust and computationally-efficient methods. Building on the Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for efficient, parameter-free and reproducible identification of network-modules simultaneously across multiple conditions. Our method can accommodate weighted (and unweighted) networks of any size and can similarly use co-expression or raw gene expression input data, without hinging upon the definition and stability of the correlation used to assess gene co-expression. In simulation studies, we demonstrated distinctive advantages of our method over existing methods, which was able to recover accurately both common and condition-specific network-modules without entailing ad-hoc input parameters as required by other approaches. We applied our method to genome-scale and multi-tissue transcriptomic datasets from rats (microarray-based) and humans (mRNA-sequencing-based) and identified several common and tissue-specific subnetworks with functional significance, which were not detected by other methods. In humans we recapitulated the crosstalk between cell-cycle progression and cell-extracellular matrix interactions processes in ventricular zones during neocortex expansion and further, we uncovered pathways related to development of later cognitive functions in the cortical plate of the developing brain which were previously unappreciated. Analyses of seven rat tissues identified a multi-tissue subnetwork of co-expressed heat shock protein (Hsp) and cardiomyopathy genes (Bag3, Cryab, Kras, Emd, Plec), which was significantly replicated using separate failing heart and liver gene expression datasets in humans, thus revealing a conserved functional role for Hsp genes in cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Human cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) frequently have a genetic contribution. Through the application of novel technologies such as next generation sequencing, DNA sequence variants associated with CVMs are being identified at a rapid pace. While clinicians are now able to offer testing with next generation sequencing gene panels or whole exome sequencing to any patient with a CVM, the interpretation of genetic variation remains problematic. Variable phenotypic expression, reduced penetrance, inconsistent phenotyping methods, and the lack of high throughput functional testing of variants, contribute to these challenges. This article elaborates critical issues that impact the decision to broadly implement clinical molecular genetic testing in CVMs. Major benefits of testing include establishing a genetic diagnosis, facilitating cost-effective screening of family members who may have subclinical disease, predicting recurrence risk in offspring, enabling early diagnosis and anticipatory management of CV and non-CV disease phenotypes, predicting long term outcomes, and facilitating the development of novel therapies aimed at disease improvement or prevention. Limitations include financial cost, psychosocial cost, and ambiguity of interpretation of results. Multiplex families and patients with syndromic features are two groups where disease causation could potentially be firmly established. However, these account for the minority of the overall CVM population, and there is increasing recognition that genotypes previously associated with syndromes also exist in patients who lack non-CV findings. In all circumstances, ongoing dialogue between cardiologists and clinical geneticists will be needed to accurately interpret genetic testing and improve these patients' health. This may be most effectively implemented by the creation and support of CV genetics services at centers committed to pursuing testing for patients.},

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONLarge-scale genetic studies of integrated health care populations, with phenotypic data captured natively in the documentation of clinical care, have the potential to unveil genetic associations that point the way to new biology and therapeutic targets. This setting also represents an ideal test bed for the implementation of genomics in routine clinical care in service of precision medicine.
RATIONALEThe DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System aims to catalyze genomic discovery and precision medicine by coupling high-throughput exome sequencing to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of participants in Geisinger's MyCode Community Health Initiative. Here, we describe initial insights from whole-exome sequencing of 50,726 adult participants of predominantly European ancestry using clinical phenotypes derived from EHRs.
RESULTSThe median duration of EHR data associated with sequenced participants was 14 years, with a median of 87 clinical encounters, 687 laboratory tests, and seven procedures per participant. Forty-eight percent of sequenced individuals had one or more first- or second-degree relatives in the sample, and genome-wide autozygosity was similar to other outbred European populations. We found \textasciitilde{}4.2 million single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which \textasciitilde{}176,000 are predicted to result in loss of gene function (LoF). The overwhelming majority of these genetic variants occurred at a minor allele frequency of $\leq$1\%, and more than half were singletons. Each participant harbored a median of 21 rare predicted LoFs. At this sample size, \textasciitilde{}92\% of sequenced genes, including genes that encode existing drug targets or confer risk for highly penetrant genetic diseases, harbor rare heterozygous predicted LoF variants. About 7\% of sequenced genes contained rare homozygous predicted LoF variants in at least one individual. Linking these data to EHR-derived laboratory phenotypes revealed consequences of partial or complete LoF in humans. Among these were previously unidentified associations between predicted LoFs in CSF2RB and basophil and eosinophil counts, and EGLN1-associated erythrocytosis segregating in genetically identified family networks. Using predicted LoFs as a model for drug target antagonism, we found associations supporting the majority of therapeutic targets for lipid lowering. To highlight the opportunity for genotype-phenotype association discovery, we performed exome-wide association analyses of EHR-derived lipid values, newly implicating rare predicted LoFs, and deleterious missense variants in G6PC in association with triglyceride levels. In a survey of 76 clinically actionable disease-associated genes, we estimated that 3.5\% of individuals harbor pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that meet criteria for clinical action. Review of the EHR uncovered findings associated with the monogenic condition in \textasciitilde{}65\% of pathogenic variant carriers' medical records.
CONCLUSIONThe findings reported here demonstrate the value of large-scale sequencing in an integrated health system population, add to the knowledge base regarding the phenotypic consequences of human genetic variation, and illustrate the challenges and promise of genomic medicine implementation. DiscovEHR provides a blueprint for large-scale precision medicine initiatives and genomics-guided therapeutic target discovery. $<$img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/354/6319/aaf6814/F1.medium.gif"/$>$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Therapeutic target validation and genomic medicine in DiscovEHR.(A) Associations between predicted LoF variants in lipid drug target genes and lipid levels.

The DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System couples high-throughput sequencing to an integrated health care system using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). We sequenced the exomes of 50,726 adult participants in the DiscovEHR study to identify \textasciitilde{}4.2 million rare single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which \textasciitilde{}176,000 are predicted to result in a loss of gene function. Linking these data to EHR-derived clinical phenotypes, we find clinical associations supporting therapeutic targets, including genes encoding drug targets for lipid lowering, and identify previously unidentified rare alleles associated with lipid levels and other blood level traits. About 3.5\% of individuals harbor deleterious variants in 76 clinically actionable genes. The DiscovEHR data set provides a blueprint for large-scale precision medicine initiatives and genomics-guided therapeutic discovery.

Despite tremendous research and clinical efforts, the molecular causes remain unknown for nearly half of the patients, due to genetic heterogeneity and conventional molecular diagnosis based on a gene-by-gene approach. We aimed to test next generation sequencing (NGS) as an efficient and cost-effective strategy to accelerate patient diagnosis. We designed a capture library to target the coding and splice site sequences of all known NMD genes and used NGS and DNA multiplexing to retrieve the pathogenic mutations in patients with heterogeneous NMD with or without known mutations. We retrieved all known mutations, including point mutations and small indels, intronic and exonic mutations, and a large deletion in a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, validating the sensitivity and reproducibility of this strategy on a heterogeneous subset of NMD with different genetic inheritance. Most pathogenic mutations were ranked on top in our blind bioinformatic pipeline. Following the same strategy, we characterized probable TTN, RYR1 and COL6A3 mutations in several patients without previous molecular diagnosis. The cost was less than conventional testing for a single large gene. With appropriate adaptations, this strategy could be implemented into a routine genetic diagnosis set-up as a first screening approach to detect most kind of mutations, potentially before the need of more invasive and specific clinical investigations. An earlier genetic diagnosis should provide improved disease management and higher quality genetic counseling, and ease access to therapy or inclusion into therapeutic trials.},

Such knowledge is of fundamental importance for our understanding of cardiogenesis and also for the diagnosis and treatment of heart malformations.},

  abstract = {Cardiogenesis is one of the earliest and most important steps during human development and is orchestrated by discrete families of heart progenitors, which build distinct regions of the fetal heart. For the past decade, a lineage map for the distinct subsets of progenitors that generate the embryonic mammalian heart has begun to lay a foundation for the development of new strategies for rebuilding the adult heart after injury, an unmet clinical need for the vast majority of patients with end-stage heart failure who are not heart transplant recipients. The studies also have implications for the root causes of congenital heart disease, which affects 1 in 50 live births, the most prevalent malformations in children. Although much of this insight has been generated in murine models, it is becoming increasingly clear that there can be important divergence with principles and pathways for human cardiogenesis, as well as for regenerative pathways. The development of human stem cell models, coupled with recent advances in genome editing with RNA-guided endonucleases, offers a new approach for the primary study of human cardiogenesis. In addition, application of the technology to the in vivo setting in large animal models, including nonhuman primates, has opened the door to genome-edited large animal models of adult and congenital heart disease, as well as a detailed mechanistic dissection of the more diverse and complex set of progenitor families and pathways, which guide human cardiogenesis. Implications of this new technology for a new generation of human-based, genetically tractable systems are discussed, along with potential therapeutic applications.},

In the second application, known as pharmacogenomics, DNA sequence variants that have been found to be associated with either beneficial effects or adverse effects of a medication may be used to help decide which medications or dosages of medications to prescribe to patients.

  abstract = {Purpose: Next-generation sequencing has transformed genetic research and is poised to revolutionize clinical diagnosis. However, the vast amount of data and inevitable discovery of incidental findings require novel analytic approaches. We therefore implemented for the first time a strategy that utilizes an a priori structured framework and a conservative threshold for selecting clinically relevant incidental findings. Methods: We categorized 2,016 genes linked with Mendelian diseases into "bins" based on clinical utility and validity and used a computational algorithm to analyze 80 whole-genome sequences in order to explore the use of such an approach in a simulated real-world setting. Results: The algorithm effectively reduced the number of variants requiring human review and identified incidental variants with likely clinical relevance. Incorporation of the Human Gene Mutation Database improved the yield for missense mutations but also revealed that a substantial proportion of purported disease-causing mutations were misleading. Conclusion: This approach is adaptable to any clinically relevant bin structure, scalable to the demands of a clinical laboratory work-flow, and flexible with respect to advances in genomics. We anticipate that application of this strategy will facilitate pretest informed consent, laboratory analysis, and posttest return of results in a clinical context. Genet Med 2013:15(1):36-44},

1. Identification of disease genes within associated loci. For example, chromosomal loci associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, artherosclerosis, etc. are found, but genes were not identified.

2. Risk stratification. For example hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with mutations in multiple genes, but those in MYBPC3 are linked with higher death risk than those in MYH7.

3. More specific genetic-based classification of disease types

4. Pharmacogenomics help to individualize treatment for better response or to predict side effects.

An interesting example given in this article is Lamin A/C (encoded by the gene LMNA). Mutations in this gene have been found to link with various and seemingly unrelated disorders. The list of disorders have grown much longer since this publication. According to the GHR (Genetic Home Reference, NIH), there are now at least 11 disorders associated with mutations in LMNA. Many of them have unknown molecular basis. Although in this paper, this wide range of impact was attributed to the gene product having "multiple functions" it is more precise to state that such diverse impact is due to the variety of modifications (post-transcriptional and post-translational) as well as its binding partners in each organ and tissues.

Trang's thinking maybe LMNA can serve as an interesting example for how existing data can shed new lights if queried the right way.}

Crowdsourcing task: participants were asked to

1. identify GEO studies belonging to 1 of these types

* single-gene perturbation on mammalian cells

* single-drug perturbation on mammalian cells

* normal vs diseased tissues

2. extract metadata from the studies

3. compute differential expression using GEO2Enrichr (chrome extension)

Although not stated explicitly, it seemed the selected data sets are limited to microarray assays, so they can be processed uniformly (batch correction, then DEG calling).

Signatures were then sanitized by automated filters and manual inspection.

\subsection{Trang:}

1. From the manuscript, it sounds they have created a large data sets with quality annotation. The design of the microtask is a decent idea. However, the web app is disappointing. Given a query for "signature", for example "myocardial infarction", it will result in a list of signatures, each associated with a single GSE id, having their own list of up- and down-regulated genes. These lists do not seem to have resulted from an integrative analysis as described in the manuscript.

The list of up- and down-regulated genes are available upon clicking on the ‘Enrichr‘ icon. There are numerous design problems on this part, and in the Enrichr links that they lead to. On the Enrichr interface, multiple sources of other experiments are presented, each showing the top genes overlapping with the gene set under investigation. It takes some time to figure out what they're showing, and these plots do not give much insight, because very different types of assays are included here (for example ENCODE Histone modification, Co-expression with some specific TFs, etc.).

2. This platform gives me an idea on organizing GEO data sets. A critical requirement for exact retrieval is the consistency of data annotations. GEO has little requirement on standardizing data annotations, resulting in loosely structured metadata. For GEO to be exploited properly and effectively, it can be curated with controlled vocabulary, like ENCODE. These tasks may be designed for crowd-sourcing and/or scaled up with machine learning. There have been many ontologies developed for such purposes in biological research, for example the assay types (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) can be annotated with OBI, UBERON for tissue sites, the biological sources can be annotated with CL for primary cell lines, etc.}

  abstract = {The average lifespan of humans is increasing, and with it the percentage of people entering the 65 and older age group is growing rapidly and will continue to do so in the next 20 years. Within this age group, cardiovascular disease will remain the leading cause of death, and the cost associated with treatment will continue to increase. Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as to how the genetic pathways that regulate aging in model organisms influence cardiovascular aging. Likewise, in the molecular biology of aging field, few studies fully assess the role of these aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and their roles regulating cardiovascular health. We then discuss a series of review articles that will appear in succession and provide a more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.},
