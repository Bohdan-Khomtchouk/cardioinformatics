Can be a good example for clinical application of ML methods (classifying heart failure subtypes), although the authors did not give sufficient motivation for this classification.},

Uchida and Dimmeler (2015)

\begin{itemize}

\item Challenges in studying lncRNAs

\begin{itemize}

\item ~~~ Intrinsic

\begin{itemize}

\item ~~~ Low abundance level

\item ~~~ Highly specific to tissue types

\item ~~~ Many have polyA tails but some (eRNAs) do not, requiring optimization of library preparation

\end{itemize}

\item Extrinsic

\begin{itemize}

\item lack of reporting standard (many individual studies do not report genomic coordinates)

\item primitive understanding about the functions

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Need to be validated: qPCR

\end{itemize}

\section{Notes}

Some interesting facts

\begin{itemize}

\item Protein-coding genes account for 2\% of the human genome, while $>$ 90\% of the genome is actively transcribed.

\item "enhancer lncRNAs do not have polyA tails" -$>$ might not be true (60\% of eRNAs are polyadenylated, 40\% are not, as in Uchida and Dimmeler, 2015)

\end{itemize}

How bioinformatics can help?

\begin{itemize}

\item An authoritative data repository can help consolidate the scattered data, and setting the standards for reporting, priming for faster accumulation of knowledge.

\end{itemize}

@article{Joyner:2011:Ten,
	Annote = {Convincing arguments in favor of integrative physiology (in contrast with systems biology) through thought-provoking questions. Two major criticized things about "omics", or systems biology, are (1) the fact that holistic consideration of living system has long been a foundation of integrative physiology, part of 'traditional biology" but seems to be dis-regarded by reductionist approaches in molecular genetics, and (2) that the hypothesis-neutral approach is not as fruitful as hypothesis-driven studies. Although the cases for (2) are not rigorously cited or demonstrated in the article, there are citations that worth further investigation:

* Pereira \& Weinshilboum 2009; Schroth et al. 2009, for the better outcome of pharmacogenetics thanks to their directed focus on hypothesis-driven studies

* Gibson 2007; Enattah et al. 2008; Ingram et al. 2009, Simonson et al. 2010; Yi et al. 2010, for fruitful research of anthropology seeking answers for specific questions on lactase persistence and genetic adaptations to extreme altitude.

Mentioned an interesting set of principles from integrative physiology: homeostasis, regulated systems and redundancy. For example a homeostatic variable such as body temperature, blood pressure, pH is kept stable around a central point due to redundant regulated systems. If one element fails, the others can pick up the job so that the homeostasis remains.},

\begin{itemize}

\item Well written

\item Methods:

\begin{itemize}

\item Using high-throughput sequencing to sequence the pre-defined set of genes (20 related to HCM and DCM, 17 to other CVD and 4 candidates) on patient samples.

\item Control sequences are from UK10K project

\item Estimate for Prob(rare nsSNP X is causal for HCM) = [Pr(X in cases) / Pr(X in controls)]~ / Pr(X in cases)

\end{itemize}

\item Results

\begin{itemize}

\item The prevalence of rare variants among control population (same idea was then supported by Walsh et al. (2017) on the larger data set from ExAC)

\item Use of HTS will result in more variants, many of which are rare but clinical significance unclear. Thus better approach is needed for clinical interpretation.

\end{itemize}

\item Useful discussion on titin: example on why functional studies are impractical

\begin{itemize}

\item largest protein in mammals

\item difficult to inteprete due to

\begin{itemize}

\item large size

\item large number of isoforms

\item unresolved 3D structure

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item Table 1. Criteria for defining a variant as pathogenic

\item Predicting pathogenicity has low specificity (?), limited accuracy (65-80\%), even with in silico algorithms that use protein structural changes, evolutionary conservation, protein function, altered splicing.

\item 60 - 90\% of rare cardiomyopathy mutations are "private", i.e. found only in single families.

\item Identical mutations in separate families have been found to be recent and independent mutational events

\end{itemize}

Compiled knowledge on genetic cardiomyophathies:

\begin{itemize}

\item hypertrophic (HCM)

\item storage and metabolic

\item restrictive

\item dilated

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)}

\begin{itemize}

\item is monogenic disorder

\item Pathogenic mutations have been established in 8 genes: MYH7, TPM1, TNNT2, MYCPC3, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, ACTC1.

\item Likely pathogenic mutations found in other 15 genes

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)}

\begin{itemize}

\item most common cause for heart transplantation

\item 16 definitive disease causing genes, 41 putative disease causing genes

\item [NOTE] (As of 2018/09/17) GWAS presents 44 associations with 69 genes (???) while Ensembl reports 52 associated genes (with DCM, dominant and DCM, recessive) -- Not sure how these numbers relate (GWAS maps phenotypes to EFO, ontology used in Ensembl is not clear)

@article{Eichler:2010:Missing,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

Gives different perspective on the possible directions to approach the problem of missing heritability

\begin{itemize}

\item structural variation: deletion/duplication/insertion (on a large region of the genome), copy number polymorphism. CNPs are repetitive, thus challenging to study with the current genoyping and sequencing technologies.

\item rare variants are rare individually but "collectively frequent", refined methods are needed to test for associations of the phenotypes and these variants

\item GWAS have been placing too much importance on genetics and cannot measure environmental interaction (GxE) in determining a phenotype

\item [Trang agrees with this one the most] Phenotypic variations cannot be explained by adding genetic effects, because of epistasis: the effect of one genes are modified by another. Genetic variations interact at different layers of genomic complexity: RNA, miRNA, protein-protein, protein-DNA, etc. Need to approach this problem with the systems biology framework which model the interaction of the systems

\item Transgenerational genetic effects: phenotypic variation in a generation result from genetic ones in previous generations, another word for epigenetics which involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, inheritance and activity of RNA and proteins of the ascendant in the gametes.

Layers of data (Figure 6.1) suggests that upon integration of these data, there is a need to not only

Despite some remarkable insights from functional genomics, the incorporation of new profiling technologies into the clinical arena has been slow, largely because of appropriate concerns regarding the need for robust validation through prospective approaches. It is difficult to see how traditional study designs can be appropriately scaled. Full exploitation of these approaches will require building investigative platforms that allow the study of integrative biology in large populations and in multiple different disease states.

	Annote = {Summary: This article identify some prospects of genomic information in diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases

1. Identification of disease genes within associated loci. For example, chromosomal loci associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, artherosclerosis, etc. are found, but genes were not identified.

2. Risk stratification. For example hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with mutations in multiple genes, but those in MYBPC3 are linked with higher death risk than those in MYH7.

3. More specific genetic-based classification of disease types

4. Pharmacogenomics help to individualize treatment for better response or to predict side effects.

An interesting example given in this article is Lamin A/C (encoded by the gene LMNA). Mutations in this gene have been found to link with various and seemingly unrelated disorders. The list of disorders have grown much longer since this publication. According to the GHR (Genetic Home Reference, NIH), there are now at least 11 disorders associated with mutations in LMNA. Many of them have unknown molecular basis. Although in this paper, this wide range of impact was attributed to the gene product having "multiple functions" it is more precise to state that such diverse impact is due to the variety of modifications (post-transcriptional and post-translational) as well as its binding partners in each organ and tissues.

Trang's thinking maybe LMNA can serve as an interesting example for how existing data can shed new lights if queried the right way.},

@article{Wang:2016:Extraction,
	Annote = {\subsection{Summary}

Crowdsourcing task: participants were asked to

1. identify GEO studies belonging to 1 of these types

* single-gene perturbation on mammalian cells

* single-drug perturbation on mammalian cells

* normal vs diseased tissues

2. extract metadata from the studies

3. compute differential expression using GEO2Enrichr (chrome extension)

Although not stated explicitly, it seemed the selected data sets are limited to microarray assays, so they can be processed uniformly (batch correction, then DEG calling).

Signatures were then sanitized by automated filters and manual inspection.

\subsection{Trang:}

1. From the manuscript, it sounds they have created a large data sets with quality annotation. The design of the microtask is a decent idea. However, the web app is disappointing. Given a query for "signature", for example "myocardial infarction", it will result in a list of signatures, each associated with a single GSE id, having their own list of up- and down-regulated genes. These lists do not seem to have resulted from an integrative analysis as described in the manuscript.

The list of up- and down-regulated genes are available upon clicking on the `Enrichr` icon. There are numerous design problems on this part, and in the Enrichr links that they lead to. On the Enrichr interface, multiple sources of other experiments are presented, each showing the top genes overlapping with the gene set under investigation. It takes some time to figure out what they're showing, and these plots do not give much insight, because very different types of assays are included here (for example ENCODE Histone modification, Co-expression with some specific TFs, etc.).

2. This platform gives me an idea on organizing GEO data sets. A critical requirement for exact retrieval is the consistency of data annotations. GEO has little requirement on standardizing data annotations, resulting in loosely structured metadata. For GEO to be exploited properly and effectively, it can be curated with controlled vocabulary, like ENCODE. These tasks may be designed for crowd-sourcing and/or scaled up with machine learning. There have been many ontologies developed for such purposes in biological research, for example the assay types (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) can be annotated with OBI, UBERON for tissue sites, the biological sources can be annotated with CL for primary cell lines, etc.},

@article{Santolini:2018:personalized,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}

\item population heterogeneity -$>$ finding of genetic associations in one subset may not apply to another subset in the population

\item homeostasis leads to multiple healthy states: different combinations of alleles lead to equally functional system

\item This study aims to pinpoint the genes that are truly correlate with disease phenotype by coupling genotyping (mouse panel), phenotyping and gene expression (microarray)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Designs}

104 genetically diverse mouse strains from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) are used, gene expression (whole heart microarray) and phenotype (heart weight) are measured right before and 3 weeks after inducing cardiac hypertrophy.

For each gene, the correlation (Pearson) is calculated between the fold-change of gene expression level and the fold-change of heart mass.

Two gene sets are identified

\begin{itemize}

\item SAM genes are significantly dis-regulated on the population levels

\item FC genes are significantly correlated with the degree of cardiac hypertrophy

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analyses}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Differential gene expressions: identify 2 gene sets as described above. Little overlap between the two sets.

\item Biological relevance: convert mouse to human genes, query for disease associations on HuGE database, perform enrichment test for diseases, resulting in 2 list of enriched diseases: SAM gene-associated and FC-gene associated. Diseases associated with FC genes are mostly cardiac, while those associated with SAM genes are less related.

\item Co-expression network

\begin{itemize}

\item 2 gene sets are pooled, PCC calculated for every pair to create co-expression networks, one for control (pre-ISO) and one for disease (post-ISO)

\item 2 distinct clusters are found, representative for each set of genes. A few genes jump from one cluster to the other in the pathological state.

\end{itemize}

\item Interacting partners

\begin{itemize}

\item convert mouse gene to human, gene to protein, query for interacting partners, perform pathway enrichment on the interacting set.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Notes}

Good examples of how even a focused study can make use of a plethora of bioinformatics analyses, and the combinations of these methods are critical in the success of an experimental design.},

@article{Walsh:2017:Reassessment,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

This work reported systematic evaluation of rare variations in selected cardiomyopathy diseases (HCM, DCM, ARVC), giving extensive examples of variants for which rareness and pathogenicity do not correlate.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Measure of variant}

\begin{itemize}

\item F\_V (Frequency of variant V) = (\# V-carriers) / (\# samples)

\item Case excess = (F\_V in clinical cohorts) - (F\_V in ExAC)

\item OR (Odd Ratio) = odds of CM given variant / odds of CM without variant

\item EF (Etiological fraction) = proportion of cases in which the variant is causal

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measure of gene}

\begin{itemize}

\item OR with confidence interval

\item (Table S6) Predicted pathogenic = Number of cases predicted to be pathogenic if carrying variants in gene X

\item (Table S6) Reported pathogenic: Number of cases where variants in gene X are pathogenic in the clinical cohorts.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

~

\section{Notes}

There seems to be a assumption popular in the field prior to this work but not explicitly stated in the paper: rareness is necessary for defining pathogenictiy. Although this notion is directly challenged in this paper, it is not quite reasonable to completely abolish the relation (!rare =$>$ !penetrant), but rather define rare in a context.

Also as put forth in the paper, variants should also be interpreted separately for each class (protein altering, truncating, non-truncating, etc.), and in the light of disease mechanisms (what the gene does, how the variant in question is affecting that function, etc).},

\item Cancer related but can be used to illustrate how novel experimental methods increasingly require computational methods to manipulate and analyze large data sets. In this study, a comprehensive list of possible Single nucleotide variant (SNP) are enumerated, and used to build a library of CRISPR-Cas9 target sites. These variants were then introduced to the HAP1 cells. Cells are then sampled at day 5 and 11 after DNA editing, counted and assayed for gDNA and RNA. Function score is calculated from the ratio log2(Freq\_SNV\_at\_day\_11 / Freq\_SNV\_in\_library), corrected for biases due to non-uniform gene editing, etc. Function score are then used to classify a variant into "functional", "non-function" and "intermediate".

Carter H: F1000Prime Recommendation of [Li J et al., Cell 2018 174(6):1361-1372.e10]. In F1000Prime, 25 Sep 2018; 10.3410/f.733954042.793550843

In this paper, whole genome sequences of patients with abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) and healthy controls are combined with electronic health records (EHRs) in order to predict which individuals are at risk for AAA. The authors find that genomic factors and EHRs both contribute information about AAA risk, and that analyzing genetic risk relative to particular lifestyle-associated covariates suggests that some patients could reduce their AAA risk with simple lifestyle changes. Analysis of AAA risk predictive genes in the context of biological networks further identifies functional modules that provide insight into mechanisms of AAA development.

This work simultaneously models AAA risk and mechanism, setting a new precedent for future studies. I particularly liked the analysis of how changes to clinical risk factors impacted predictions of patient outcome for patients with different levels of genetic risk, which illustrates how these factors can be combined in clinical practice to identify patients that could benefit from lifestyle changes.

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate the integration of different layers of data and application of Machine Learning toward improving understanding of disease and improving care.

\item AAA provides an example of complex disease where GWAS can hardly agree on a few risk loci. A review paper was cited (Bradley et al. 2016) - should check this one out.

@article{Manolio:2009:Finding,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

A milestone and regularly cited review that outlines a number of possible sources of missing heritability.

\subsection{How to define and calculate heritability?}

Narrow-sense heritability \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}}, is the "proportion of phenotypic variance in a population attributable to additive genetic factors"

Broad-sense heritability is not mentioned in the paper.

\subsection{How to know if heritability is missing or not?}

Given the \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}} of a biological marker, one can predict the phenotype on the new set of individuals. If all the heritability has been accounted for, the squared correlation between the observed and the predicted phenotype should be equal to \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}}.

\subsection{Possible sources of missing heritability}

\begin{itemize}

\item rare variants - variants too rare to be detected

\item structural variants, i.e copy number variant, inversions, translocation, microsatellite repeat expansions, etc. - not measurable with techniques of the time, most focus have been on SNPs

\end{itemize}

~

\section{Notes}

Under the light of new research, the causes of missing heritability can be re-organized into

\begin{itemize}

\item technical limitations

\begin{itemize}

\item rare variants - need more power to detect, either by increasing sample size or improve statistical analyses

\item structural variants - largely ignored

\end{itemize}

\item system complexity

\begin{itemize}

\item polygenic and omnigenic traits: phenotype is determined by a large number of genes, each contribute a small effect size

\item epigenetics: factors not obvious in genetic information

\end{itemize}

\item conceptual limitation

\begin{itemize}

\item epistasis: non-additive effects can occur from gene x gene interactions

\item gene x environment interactions

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Wearable device designed to capture biotic and abiotic exposure within 2 meter of the participants.

\begin{itemize}

\item Abiotic airbone particles were collected and measured in real time using RTI MicroPEM

\item Biotic samples were collected by the filters before moving to MicroPEM unit

\item Each sampling and monitoring periodlasting for 1-14 days. At the end of such period, filters and cartridges were removed and stored at -80oC. For biotic samples, DNA and RNA were extracted and libraries were prepared for next-gen sequencing.

\end{itemize}

Each sample gave a median of 62.2M (DNA) and 45.8M (RNA) paired-end reads. In total, the data set has 43B DNA and 30B RNA reads. The study covered 15 individuals, sampled over the period of 890 days.

\subsection{9p21.3 locus}

\begin{itemize}

\item A block of SNPs associated first with CAD and later with multiple phenotypes (primary open angle glaucoma, normal pressure glaucoma, glioma, type-2 diabetes)

\item in an intergenic region adjacent to the genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)}

\begin{itemize}

\item Caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries

\item Progress:

\item Accumulation of fat (cholesterol, triglycerides) -$>$ Taken up by tissue macrophages. These macrophages then form foam cells which produce a lot of chemokines and cytokines. The plaques consist of these foam cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cellular debris are formed on the artery, vulnerable to rupture, can trigger thrombosis, forming blood clots and leading to myocardial infarction.

\end{itemize}

~

\section{Notes}

This paper juxtaposed a number of findings to highlight the confusion about the functional role of this locus in confering the CAD risk.

\begin{itemize}

\item Enhancer function was established with targeted deletion in mice: removing 9p21 sequence leads to reduced expression of CDKN2A/B

\item Chromatin conformation (3C) study + Flourescent in-situ hybridization suggested the physical interactions

\begin{itemize}

\item in the short range with CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP

\item in the long range ($>$ million bp) with INFA21

\end{itemize}

\item Study measuring INFA21 blood level in healthy participants showed no association between the INFA21 level and the risk allele

\item Expression profiling on (cultured) macrophages revealed DE of cytokines and chemokines, but not of INFA21

\end{itemize}

This example illustrates how multiple experiments can create more confusion instead of biological insights.},

\item Bioinformatic Harvester and Sciencenet are proof-of-concept implementation for the idea of searchable biological data/scientific knowledge.

\item Notable points about the contemporary need of resource

\end{itemize}

Although various programs are available for exploring the properties of sets of genes, transcripts, and proteins, the ideal software tool, in my opinion, has yet to be created. Such software would be 1)~free:~publicly available, cross-platform, and open source, with database architecture and algorithms described in peer-reviewed publications; 2)~comprehensive:~able to draw on a wide variety of leading database resources; 3)~updated:~regularly, coordinated with releases of major sequence and functional databases; 4)~smart:~capable of automatically recognizing ID types and thus determining the relevant species and relationships between genes and their products; and 5)~flexible:~allowing a choice of analytical methods and output formats.

\begin{itemize}

\item [Trang] A common pattern coming from the resources presented in this guide is the focus on a single or a small number of research subjects at a time: a gene, a protein, a drug. The typical search results of such query are thus limited to information surrounding that query. Upon request (mostly in the form of hyperlinks), users will be directed to the original database. It is not long before one recognize that the information is too much to be perceived by means of following hyperlinks and scrolling down web pages.

\item Pondering on these resources made me think that bioinformatics training is in dire need to leverage these information and retaining researcher sanity. In order to move forward turning data into knowledge, we need more compact and efficient representation of data (which can be provided by data vis) and more robust synthesis of knowledge (which can be obtained by enhancing bioinformatics literacy, i.e. sufficient proficiency in navigating these data ocean, formulating the questions and performing the required analyses.

This study employs existing data sets to address some key questions regarding the missing heritability problem

1. Complex traits have been known to be attributable to multiple genes, each contribute a small fraction into the phenotypic variance. Is this architecture a common pattern or specific to a few complex traits?

Using loci that have been associated with height, the authors have shown that the distribution of p-values is highly skewed toward small (less significant) p-values, and that low p-value variants accounted for 86\% of heritability.

2. Genetic signals are known to be enriched in active chromatin. Is this enrichment specific for cell type?

It turns out there is little enrichment of significant variants among the cell-type-specific active regions vs universally active ones.

Based on the findings above, the authors proposed the omnigenic model for complex trait, in which a few core genes affect the trait directly, a larger number of peripheral genes affect the traits via these core genes, thus contributing a small but non-zero effect to the phenotypic variance.

This model implies a number of challenges to understand complex traits

\begin{itemize}

\item Comprehensive model system that can capture the interconnectedness of cell regulatory networks

\item Better understanding of regulatory networks, both in experimental techniques and analysis methodology

@article{Denny:2013:Systematic,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

In contrast to GWAS which test for association of variants in the genome with a given phenotype, PheWAS is the opposite approach where one tests for the association of phenotypes with a variants.

As illustrated in this paper, it can be a complementary tool to GWAS, especially to reveal pleiotropy.

\subsection{Materials and methods}

This analysis used the electrical medical records (EMRs) associated with genomic data collected by the eMERGE network which include 5 institutions at that time. eMERGE network now includes 9 centers and provides a larger data sets accessible through dbGaP.

PheWAS phenotypes are the billing codes taken from EMR. These phenotypes were then matched to the traits in NHGRI catalog to evaluate the extent of replication.

Selected SNPs from NHGRI catalog are tested individually for association with a panel of 1358 phenotypes, using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model adjusted for age, sex, study site and the first three principle components.

~

\subsection{Main results}

\begin{itemize}

\item Replicated a large fraction~(66\%) of associations catalogued in the NHGRI GWAS database.

\item Revealed a number of pleiotropic variants, for example

\begin{itemize}

\item 9p21.3 locus (harboring the gene CDKN2BAS, known for association with coronary artery disease) is found to associate with other phenotypes such as abdominal aortic aneurysms and carotid stenosis after adjusted for comorbidity.

\item rs2647044 (intergenic variant) near HLA-DQB1 associated with 9 phenotypes including many celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and lupus

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}

\item High false positive rate (not sure how the authors estimate this number, but it is reasonably expected, due to the limitations inherent to EMR data)

\item Due to the use of billing code in EMR, "pleiotropy" is clinically defined, thus multiple traits can have the same underlying mechanism and are not truly pleiotropy.

\item Billing codes can be too narrow or too broad in defining a disease, not optimized for computational analysis.

\item eMERGE samples are taken from clinical population which tends to be older and sicker than the general population.

\end{itemize}

Advantage of precision medicine approach

\begin{itemize}

\item More accurate diagnosis and treatment

\item Safer drug prescription

\item Better disease prevention and thus reduction in healthcare cost

\end{itemize}

The need of bioinformatics lies in

processing, visualization, interpretation of a patient multi-omic profile

integration of the profiles with clinical data for mechanistic understanding of their disease, facilitating more personalized treatment

GA4GH Beacon Project - an initiative to develop an open sharing platform which can then be used by data repository to provide data via simple web service without compromising sensitive data.

"Precision bioinformatics"

\begin{itemize}

\item is a branch of translational bioinformatics that specializes in the development of computational infrastructures, methodologies and tools required for clinical studies that adopt a precision medicine paradigm.

\end{itemize}

Bioinformatics problems in precision medicine

\begin{itemize}

\item implement platforms for big data processing and integration (including EHRs)

\item establish secure protocols and standards for data exchange

\item develop computational methods for analysis (visualize, interpret and summarize) in the clinical setting, to facilitate decision-making

\end{itemize}

\section{Notes}

Interesting claim about cancer being the most advanced topic in precision medicine (because we're also looking at cancer as a field with most advanced bioinformatics research)

Although the model of precision medicine may apply to many diseases, cancer is the disease for which it is clearly most advanced at this time.~

Among the three areas precision bioinformatics indicated above (big data platforms, data exchange protocols and computational methods), the first two areas are general for all bioinformatics research that call for the assembly of large and heterogenous data. The last area depends heavily on the specific biological questions at hands. For example in clinical setting, softwares should aim at facilitating clinical decision making. Such requirement may lead to focus on juxtaposing patient profile against the population, enabling user request for relevant piece of information. In the setting of basic research, the methods and tools are more disease-centric, or gene-centric, instead of being patient-centric.

@article{Jostins:2011:Genetic,
	Annote = {\section{Summary}

Evaluate the performance of genetic risk score derived from GWAS variants, for the prediction of many complex diseases including breast cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc.

Predictive power for a disease, measured in Area Under the ROC (AUC) is calculated from a close-form formula involving the the variant frequency, the penetrance, and the prevalence of disease. The formula is derived on the binary encoding of a pathogenic variant: being present of absent in the affected or unaffected individual.

CAD exhibit very small AUC despite having a very large sample size.

\section{Notes}

Interesting result, but not sure what to take from this survey, because the estimate of AUC is theoretical and there is not enough information on how the values of variables in the AUC formula were obtained.

\subsection{Two-step integration}

\subsubsection{Calculate stage-specific transcription factor binding probability}

\begin{itemize}

\item Build logistic regression models that predict the binding preference of 17 TFs on 2 cell types

\item Input features

\begin{itemize}

\item Hit of positional weight matrix (PWM) scan: a hit results in positive response, no hit results in negative response

\item Sequence-based features of nearby genes

\item Expression level of nearby genes

\item Histone marks and RNA-polyII phosphorylation

\end{itemize}

\item Models were trained on 16 TFs and tested on the remaining one.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inferring dynamic regulatory networks during cardiac differentiation}

Added temporal expression profiles (RNA-seq) and perturbation data (ChIP-seq)

Final model can predict, for any given gene involved in cardiac differentiation, which TF(s) are direct regulators and the TFBS.

\subsection{Datasets}

TFBS downloaded from ChIPBase, RNA-seq, histone modification and RNAP from GEO

Perturbation experiments for 189 TFs were compiled manually from previous publications.
