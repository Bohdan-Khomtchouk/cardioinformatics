Here, we describe an association between myocardial infarction (MI) and a common sequence variant on chromosome 9p21. This study included a total of 4587 cases and 12,767 controls. The identified variant, adjacent to the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, was associated with the disease with high significance. Approximately 21\% of individuals in the population are homozygous for this variant, and their estimated risk of suffering myocardial infarction is 1.64 times as great as that of noncarriers. The corresponding risk is 2.02 times as great for early-onset cases. The population attributable risk is 21\% for MI in general and 31\% for early-onset cases.},

We used genome-wide association scanning to identify a 58-kilobase interval on chromosome 9p21 that was consistently associated with CHD in six independent samples (more than 23,000 participants) from four Caucasian populations. This interval, which is located near the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes, contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established CHD risk factors such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension, or diabetes. Homozygotes for the risk allele make up 20 to 25\% of Caucasians and have a \~{}30 to 40\% increased risk of CHD.},

In this smartphone-based study of cardiovascular health, participants recorded physical activity, filled out health questionnaires, and completed a 6-minute walk test. The app was available to download within the United States.The feasibility of consent and data collection entirely on a smartphone, the use of machine learning to cluster participants, and the associations between activity patterns, life satisfaction, and self-reported disease.From the launch to the time of the data freeze for this study (March to October 2015), the number of individuals (self-selected) who consented to participate was 48,968, representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Their median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 27-50 years), and 82.2\\% (30,338 male, 6556 female, 10 other, and 3115 unknown) were male. In total, 40,017 (81.7\\% of those who consented) uploaded data. Among those who consented, 20,345 individuals (41.5\\%) completed 4 of the 7 days of motion data collection, and 4552 individuals (9.3\\%) completed all 7 days. Among those who consented, 40,017 (81.7\\%) filled out some portion of the questionnaires, and 4990 (10.2\\%) completed the 6-minute walk test, made available only at the end of 7 days. The Heart Age Questionnaire, also available after 7 days, required entering lipid values and age 40 to 79 years (among 17,245 individuals, 43.1\\% of participants). Consequently, 1334 (2.7\\%) of those who consented completed all fields needed to compute heart age and a 10-year risk score. Physical activity was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.5\\% (8.0\\%) of individuals’ total recorded time. Physical activity patterns were identified by cluster analysis. A pattern of lower overall activity but more frequent transitions between active and inactive states was associated with equivalent self-reported cardiovascular disease as a pattern of higher overall activity with fewer transitions. Individuals’ perception of their activity and risk bore little relation to sensor-estimated activity or calculated cardiovascular risk.A smartphone-based study of cardiovascular health is feasible, and improvements in participant diversity and engagement will maximize yield from consented participants. Large-scale, real-world assessment of physical activity, fitness, and sleep using mobile devices may be a useful addition to future population health studies.}",

Does not give much new information regarding the current understanding of how ML methods perform (e.g. binary tree tends to overfit, performance critically depends on the choice of predictors which in turn depends on the application of domain knowledge).

Can be a good example for clinical application of ML methods (classifying heart failure subtypes), although the authors did not give sufficient motivation for this classification.}

Uchida and Dimmeler (2015)

\begin{itemize}

\item Challenges in studying lncRNAs

\begin{itemize}

\item ~~~ Intrinsic

\begin{itemize}

\item ~~~ Low abundance level

\item ~~~ Highly specific to tissue types

\item ~~~ Many have polyA tails but some (eRNAs) do not, requiring optimization of library preparation

\end{itemize}

\item Extrinsic

\begin{itemize}

\item lack of reporting standard (many individual studies do not report genomic coordinates)

\item primitive understanding about the functions

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Need to be validated: qPCR

\end{itemize}

\section{Notes}

Some interesting facts

\begin{itemize}

\item Protein-coding genes account for 2\% of the human genome, while $>$ 90\% of the genome is actively transcribed.

\item "enhancer lncRNAs do not have polyA tails" -$>$ might not be true (60\% of eRNAs are polyadenylated, 40\% are not, as in Uchida and Dimmeler, 2015)

\end{itemize}

How bioinformatics can help?

\begin{itemize}

\item An authoritative data repository can help consolidate the scattered data, and setting the standards for reporting, priming for faster accumulation of knowledge.

\end{itemize}

Two major criticized things about "omics", or systems biology, are (1) the fact that holistic consideration of living system has long been a foundation of integrative physiology, part of 'traditional biology" but seems to be dis-regarded by reductionist approaches in molecular genetics, and (2) that the hypothesis-neutral approach is not as fruitful as hypothesis-driven studies. Although the cases for (2) are not rigorously cited or demonstrated in the article, there are citations that worth further investigation:

* Pereira \& Weinshilboum 2009; Schroth et al. 2009, for the better outcome of pharmacogenetics thanks to their directed focus on hypothesis-driven studies

* Gibson 2007; Enattah et al. 2008; Ingram et al. 2009, Simonson et al. 2010; Yi et al. 2010, for fruitful research of anthropology seeking answers for specific questions on lactase persistence and genetic adaptations to extreme altitude.

Mentioned an interesting set of principles from integrative physiology: homeostasis, regulated systems and redundancy. For example a homeostatic variable such as body temperature, blood pressure, pH is kept stable around a central point due to redundant regulated systems. If one element fails, the others can pick up the job so that the homeostasis remains.}

\item Methods:

\begin{itemize}

\item Using high-throughput sequencing to sequence the pre-defined set of genes (20 related to HCM and DCM, 17 to other CVD and 4 candidates) on patient samples.

\item Control sequences are from UK10K project

\item Estimate for Prob(rare nsSNP X is causal for HCM) = [Pr(X in cases) / Pr(X in controls)]~ / Pr(X in cases)

\end{itemize}

\item Results

\begin{itemize}

\item The prevalence of rare variants among control population (same idea was then supported by Walsh et al. (2017) on the larger data set from ExAC)

\item Use of HTS will result in more variants, many of which are rare but clinical significance unclear. Thus better approach is needed for clinical interpretation.

\end{itemize}

\item Useful discussion on titin: example on why functional studies are impractical

\begin{itemize}

\item largest protein in mammals

    abstract = { Systems medicine is a holistic approach to deciphering the complexity of human physiology in health and disease. In essence, a living body is constituted of networks of dynamically interacting units (molecules, cells, organs, etc) that underlie its collective functions. Declining resilience because of aging and other chronic environmental exposures drives the system to transition from a health state to a disease state; these transitions, triggered by acute perturbations or chronic disturbance, manifest as qualitative shifts in the interactions and dynamics of the disease-perturbed networks. Understanding health-to-disease transitions poses a high-dimensional nonlinear reconstruction problem that requires deep understanding of biology and innovation in study design, technology, and data analysis. With a focus on the principles of systems medicine, this Review discusses approaches for deciphering this biological complexity from a novel perspective, namely, understanding how disease-perturbed networks function; their study provides insights into fundamental disease mechanisms. The immediate goals for systems medicine are to identify early transitions to cardiovascular (and other chronic) diseases and to accelerate the translation of new preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic targets into clinical practice, a critical step in the development of personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory (P4) medicine. }

Here, we present an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity.},

We investigated the ability of wearable sensors to follow physiological changes that occur over the course of a day, during illness and other activities. Data from these sensors revealed personalized differences in daily patterns of activities. Interestingly, we discovered striking changes in particular environments such as airline flights. Blood oxygen levels decreased during high-altitude flights, and this decrease was associated with fatigue. By combining sensor information with frequent medical measurements, we made two important health-related observations. First, wearable sensors were useful in identifying the onset of Lyme disease and inflammation. From this observation, we then developed a computational algorithm for personalized disease detection using such sensors. Second, we found that wearable sensors can reveal physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals, raising the possibility that these sensors could help detect risk for type 2 diabetes. Overall, these results indicate that the information provided by wearable sensors is physiologically meaningful and actionable. Wearable sensors are likely to play an important role in managing health.},

Mammalian cells have a very large proportion of their genome inactive and also contain seven genes that have regions of homology with the yeast sir2 gene. One of these mammalian genes, sir2α, is the presumptive mammalian homologue of the yeast sir2 gene. We set out to determine if sir2αplays a role in mammalian gene silencing by creating a strain of mice carrying a null allele of sir2α. Animals carrying two null alleles of sir2αwere smaller than normal at birth, and most died during the early postnatal period. In an outbred background, the sir2αnull animals often survived to adulthood, but both sexes were sterile. We found no evidence for failure of gene silencing in sir2αnull animals, suggesting that either SIR2αhas a different role in mammals than it does in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or that its role in gene silencing in confined to a small subset of mammalian genes. The phenotype of the sir2αnull animals suggests that the SIR2αprotein is essential for normal embryogenesis and for normal reproduction in both sexes.},

We showed previously that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) acts as a suppressor of cardiac hypertrophy and that mice lacking HDAC9 are sensitized to cardiac stress signals. Here we report that mice lacking HDAC5 display a similar cardiac phenotype and develop profoundly enlarged hearts in response to pressure overload resulting from aortic constriction or constitutive cardiac activation of calcineurin, a transducer of cardiac stress signals. In contrast, mice lacking either HDAC5 or HDAC9 show a hypertrophic response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation identical to that of wild-type littermates, suggesting that these HDACs modulate a specific subset of cardiac stress response pathways. We also show that compound mutant mice lacking both HDAC5 and HDAC9 show a propensity for lethal ventricular septal defects and thin-walled myocardium. These findings reveal central roles for HDACs 5 and 9 in the suppression of a subset of cardiac stress signals as well as redundant functions in the control of cardiac development.},

    abstract = { Precision medicine is an integrative approach to cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment that considers an individual’s genetics, lifestyle, and exposures as determinants of their cardiovascular health and disease phenotypes. This focus overcomes the limitations of reductionism in medicine, which presumes that all patients with the same signs of disease share a common pathophenotype and, therefore, should be treated similarly. Precision medicine incorporates standard clinical and health record data with advanced panomics (ie, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics) for deep phenotyping. These phenotypic data can then be analyzed within the framework of molecular interaction (interactome) networks to uncover previously unrecognized disease phenotypes and relationships between diseases, and to select pharmacotherapeutics or identify potential protein–drug or drug–drug interactions. In this review, we discuss the current spectrum of cardiovascular health and disease, population averages and the response of extreme phenotypes to interventions, and population-based versus high-risk treatment strategies as a pretext to understanding a precision medicine approach to cardiovascular disease prevention and therapeutic interventions. We also consider the search for resilience and Mendelian disease genes and argue against the theory of a single causal gene/gene product as a mediator of the cardiovascular disease phenotype, as well as an Erlichian magic bullet to solve cardiovascular disease. Finally, we detail the importance of deep phenotyping and interactome networks and the use of this information for rational polypharmacy. These topics highlight the urgent need for precise phenotyping to advance precision medicine as a strategy to improve cardiovascular health and prevent disease. }

Gives different perspective on the possible directions to approach the problem of missing heritability

\begin{itemize}

\item structural variation: deletion/duplication/insertion (on a large region of the genome), copy number polymorphism. CNPs are repetitive, thus challenging to study with the current genoyping and sequencing technologies.

\item rare variants are rare individually but "collectively frequent", refined methods are needed to test for associations of the phenotypes and these variants

\item GWAS have been placing too much importance on genetics and cannot measure environmental interaction (GxE) in determining a phenotype

\item [Trang agrees with this one the most] Phenotypic variations cannot be explained by adding genetic effects, because of epistasis: the effect of one genes are modified by another. Genetic variations interact at different layers of genomic complexity: RNA, miRNA, protein-protein, protein-DNA, etc. Need to approach this problem with the systems biology framework which model the interaction of the systems

\item Transgenerational genetic effects: phenotypic variation in a generation result from genetic ones in previous generations, another word for epigenetics which involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, inheritance and activity of RNA and proteins of the ascendant in the gametes.

Despite some remarkable insights from functional genomics, the incorporation of new profiling technologies into the clinical arena has been slow, largely because of appropriate concerns regarding the need for robust validation through prospective approaches. It is difficult to see how traditional study designs can be appropriately scaled.

	Abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We explored whether use of deep learning to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records (EHRs) would improve model performance in predicting initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) compared to conventional methods that ignore temporality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were from a health system's EHR on 3884 incident HF cases and 28 903 controls, identified as primary care patients, between May 16, 2000, and May 23, 2013. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models using gated recurrent units (GRUs) were adapted to detect relations among time-stamped events (eg, disease diagnosis, medication orders, procedure orders, etc.) with a 12- to 18-month observation window of cases and controls. Model performance metrics were compared to regularized logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor classifier approaches. RESULTS: Using a 12-month observation window, the area under the curve (AUC) for the RNN model was 0.777, compared to AUCs for logistic regression (0.747), multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer (0.765), support vector machine (SVM) (0.743), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) (0.730). When using an 18-month observation window, the AUC for the RNN model increased to 0.883 and was significantly higher than the 0.834 AUC for the best of the baseline methods (MLP). CONCLUSION: Deep learning models adapted to leverage temporal relations appear to improve performance of models for detection of incident heart failure with a short observation window of 12-18 months.},

AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.},

    abstract = "{Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the ‘black-box’ criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated (‘labelled’) data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.}",

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In-hospital cardiac arrest is a major burden to public health, which affects patient safety. Although traditional track-and-trigger systems are used to predict cardiac arrest early, they have limitations, with low sensitivity and high false-alarm rates. We propose a deep learning-based early warning system that shows higher performance than the existing track-and-trigger systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed patients who were admitted to 2 hospitals from June 2010 to July 2017. A total of 52 131 patients were included. Specifically, a recurrent neural network was trained using data from June 2010 to January 2017. The result was tested using the data from February to July 2017. The primary outcome was cardiac arrest, and the secondary outcome was death without attempted resuscitation. As comparative measures, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the net reclassification index. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity while varying the number of alarms. The deep learning-based early warning system (AUROC: 0.850; AUPRC: 0.044) significantly outperformed a modified early warning score (AUROC: 0.603; AUPRC: 0.003), a random forest algorithm (AUROC: 0.780; AUPRC: 0.014), and logistic regression (AUROC: 0.613; AUPRC: 0.007). Furthermore, the deep learning-based early warning system reduced the number of alarms by 82.2{\%}, 13.5{\%}, and 42.1{\%} compared with the modified early warning system, random forest, and logistic regression, respectively, at the same sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on deep learning had high sensitivity and a low false-alarm rate for detection of patients with cardiac arrest in the multicenter study.},

	Abstract = {Non-invasive imaging plays a critical role in managing patients with cardiovascular disease. Although subjective visual interpretation remains the clinical mainstay, quantitative analysis facilitates objective, evidence-based management, and advances in clinical research. This has driven developments in computing and software tools aimed at achieving fully automated image processing and quantitative analysis. In parallel, machine learning techniques have been used to rapidly integrate large amounts of clinical and quantitative imaging data to provide highly personalized individual patient-based conclusions. Areas covered: This review summarizes recent advances in automated quantitative imaging in cardiology and describes the latest techniques which incorporate machine learning principles. The review focuses on the cardiac imaging techniques which are in wide clinical use. It also discusses key issues and obstacles for these tools to become utilized in mainstream clinical practice. Expert commentary: Fully-automated processing and high-level computer interpretation of cardiac imaging are becoming a reality. Application of machine learning to the vast amounts of quantitative data generated per scan and integration with clinical data also facilitates a move to more patient-specific interpretation. These developments are unlikely to replace interpreting physicians but will provide them with highly accurate tools to detect disease, risk-stratify, and optimize patient-specific treatment. However, with each technological advance, we move further from human dependence and closer to fully-automated machine interpretation.},

However, medical imaging presents uniquely pertinent obstacles such as a lack of accessible data or a high-cost of annotation. To address this, we developed data-efficient deep learning classifiers for prediction tasks in cardiology. Using pipeline supervised models to focus relevant structures, we achieve an accuracy of 94.4{\%} for 15-view still-image echocardiographic view classification and 91.2{\%} accuracy for binary left ventricular hypertrophy classification. We then develop semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. We achieve greater than 80{\%} accuracy in view classification with only 4{\%} of labeled data used in solely supervised techniques and achieve 92.3{\%} accuracy for left ventricular hypertrophy classification. In exploring trade-offs between model type, resolution, data resources, and performance, we present a comprehensive analysis and improvements of efficient deep learning solutions for medical imaging assessment especially in cardiology.},

Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI wherein machines autonomously acquire information by extracting patterns from large databases, has been increasingly used within the medical community, and specifically within the domain of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present a brief overview of ML methodologies that are used for the construction of inferential and predictive data-driven models. We highlight several domains of ML application such as echocardiography, electrocardiography, and recently developed non-invasive imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography. We conclude by reviewing the limitations associated with contemporary application of ML algorithms within the cardiovascular disease field.}",

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Omics sciences enable a systems-level perspective in characterizing cardiovascular biology. Integration of diverse proteomics data via a computational strategy will catalyze the assembly of contextualized knowledge, foster discoveries through multidisciplinary investigations, and minimize unnecessary redundancy in research efforts. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project is to develop a consolidated cardiac proteome knowledgebase with novel bioinformatics pipeline and Web portals, thereby serving as a new resource to advance cardiovascular biology and medicine. METHODS AND RESULTS: We created Cardiac Organellar Protein Atlas Knowledgebase (COPaKB; www.HeartProteome.org), a centralized platform of high-quality cardiac proteomic data, bioinformatics tools, and relevant cardiovascular phenotypes. Currently, COPaKB features 8 organellar modules, comprising 4203 LC-MS/MS experiments from human, mouse, drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as expression images of 10,924 proteins in human myocardium. In addition, the Java-coded bioinformatics tools provided by COPaKB enable cardiovascular investigators in all disciplines to retrieve and analyze pertinent organellar protein properties of interest. CONCLUSIONS: COPaKB provides an innovative and interactive resource that connects research interests with the new biological discoveries in protein sciences. With an array of intuitive tools in this unified Web server, nonproteomics investigators can conveniently collaborate with proteomics specialists to dissect the molecular signatures of cardiovascular phenotypes.},

1. Identification of disease genes within associated loci. For example, chromosomal loci associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, artherosclerosis, etc. are found, but genes were not identified.

2. Risk stratification. For example hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with mutations in multiple genes, but those in MYBPC3 are linked with higher death risk than those in MYH7.

3. More specific genetic-based classification of disease types

4. Pharmacogenomics help to individualize treatment for better response or to predict side effects.

An interesting example given in this article is Lamin A/C (encoded by the gene LMNA). Mutations in this gene have been found to link with various and seemingly unrelated disorders. The list of disorders have grown much longer since this publication. According to the GHR (Genetic Home Reference, NIH), there are now at least 11 disorders associated with mutations in LMNA. Many of them have unknown molecular basis. Although in this paper, this wide range of impact was attributed to the gene product having "multiple functions" it is more precise to state that such diverse impact is due to the variety of modifications (post-transcriptional and post-translational) as well as its binding partners in each organ and tissues.

Trang's thinking maybe LMNA can serve as an interesting example for how existing data can shed new lights if queried the right way.}

Crowdsourcing task: participants were asked to

1. identify GEO studies belonging to 1 of these types

* single-gene perturbation on mammalian cells

* single-drug perturbation on mammalian cells

* normal vs diseased tissues

2. extract metadata from the studies

3. compute differential expression using GEO2Enrichr (chrome extension)

Although not stated explicitly, it seemed the selected data sets are limited to microarray assays, so they can be processed uniformly (batch correction, then DEG calling).

Signatures were then sanitized by automated filters and manual inspection.

\subsection{Trang:}

1. From the manuscript, it sounds they have created a large data sets with quality annotation. The design of the microtask is a decent idea. However, the web app is disappointing. Given a query for "signature", for example "myocardial infarction", it will result in a list of signatures, each associated with a single GSE id, having their own list of up- and down-regulated genes. These lists do not seem to have resulted from an integrative analysis as described in the manuscript.

The list of up- and down-regulated genes are available upon clicking on the `Enrichr` icon. There are numerous design problems on this part, and in the Enrichr links that they lead to. On the Enrichr interface, multiple sources of other experiments are presented, each showing the top genes overlapping with the gene set under investigation. It takes some time to figure out what they're showing, and these plots do not give much insight, because very different types of assays are included here (for example ENCODE Histone modification, Co-expression with some specific TFs, etc.).

2. This platform gives me an idea on organizing GEO data sets. A critical requirement for exact retrieval is the consistency of data annotations. GEO has little requirement on standardizing data annotations, resulting in loosely structured metadata. For GEO to be exploited properly and effectively, it can be curated with controlled vocabulary, like ENCODE. These tasks may be designed for crowd-sourcing and/or scaled up with machine learning. There have been many ontologies developed for such purposes in biological research, for example the assay types (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) can be annotated with OBI, UBERON for tissue sites, the biological sources can be annotated with CL for primary cell lines, etc.}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}

\item population heterogeneity -$>$ finding of genetic associations in one subset may not apply to another subset in the population

\item homeostasis leads to multiple healthy states: different combinations of alleles lead to equally functional system

\item This study aims to pinpoint the genes that are truly correlate with disease phenotype by coupling genotyping (mouse panel), phenotyping and gene expression (microarray)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Designs}

104 genetically diverse mouse strains from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) are used, gene expression (whole heart microarray) and phenotype (heart weight) are measured right before and 3 weeks after inducing cardiac hypertrophy.

For each gene, the correlation (Pearson) is calculated between the fold-change of gene expression level and the fold-change of heart mass.

Two gene sets are identified

\begin{itemize}

\item SAM genes are significantly dis-regulated on the population levels

\item FC genes are significantly correlated with the degree of cardiac hypertrophy

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analyses}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Differential gene expressions: identify 2 gene sets as described above. Little overlap between the two sets.

\item Biological relevance: convert mouse to human genes, query for disease associations on HuGE database, perform enrichment test for diseases, resulting in 2 list of enriched diseases: SAM gene-associated and FC-gene associated. Diseases associated with FC genes are mostly cardiac, while those associated with SAM genes are less related.

\item Co-expression network

\begin{itemize}

\item 2 gene sets are pooled, PCC calculated for every pair to create co-expression networks, one for control (pre-ISO) and one for disease (post-ISO)

\item 2 distinct clusters are found, representative for each set of genes. A few genes jump from one cluster to the other in the pathological state.

\end{itemize}

\item Interacting partners

\begin{itemize}

\item convert mouse gene to human, gene to protein, query for interacting partners, perform pathway enrichment on the interacting set.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Notes}

Good examples of how even a focused study can make use of a plethora of bioinformatics analyses, and the combinations of these methods are critical in the success of an experimental design.}

This work reported systematic evaluation of rare variations in selected cardiomyopathy diseases (HCM, DCM, ARVC), giving extensive examples of variants for which rareness and pathogenicity do not correlate.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Measure of variant}

\begin{itemize}

\item F\_V (Frequency of variant V) = (\# V-carriers) / (\# samples)

\item Case excess = (F\_V in clinical cohorts) - (F\_V in ExAC)

\item OR (Odd Ratio) = odds of CM given variant / odds of CM without variant

\item EF (Etiological fraction) = proportion of cases in which the variant is causal

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measure of gene}

\begin{itemize}

\item OR with confidence interval

\item (Table S6) Predicted pathogenic = Number of cases predicted to be pathogenic if carrying variants in gene X

\item (Table S6) Reported pathogenic: Number of cases where variants in gene X are pathogenic in the clinical cohorts.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

~

\section{Notes}

There seems to be a assumption popular in the field prior to this work but not explicitly stated in the paper: rareness is necessary for defining pathogenictiy. Although this notion is directly challenged in this paper, it is not quite reasonable to completely abolish the relation (!rare =$>$ !penetrant), but rather define rare in a context.

Also as put forth in the paper, variants should also be interpreted separately for each class (protein altering, truncating, non-truncating, etc.), and in the light of disease mechanisms (what the gene does, how the variant in question is affecting that function, etc).}

\item Cancer related but can be used to illustrate how novel experimental methods increasingly require computational methods to manipulate and analyze large data sets. In this study, a comprehensive list of possible Single nucleotide variant (SNP) are enumerated, and used to build a library of CRISPR-Cas9 target sites. These variants were then introduced to the HAP1 cells. Cells are then sampled at day 5 and 11 after DNA editing, counted and assayed for gDNA and RNA. Function score is calculated from the ratio log2(Freq\_SNV\_at\_day\_11 / Freq\_SNV\_in\_library), corrected for biases due to non-uniform gene editing, etc. Function score are then used to classify a variant into "functional", "non-function" and "intermediate".

In this paper, whole genome sequences of patients with abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) and healthy controls are combined with electronic health records (EHRs) in order to predict which individuals are at risk for AAA. The authors find that genomic factors and EHRs both contribute information about AAA risk, and that analyzing genetic risk relative to particular lifestyle-associated covariates suggests that some patients could reduce their AAA risk with simple lifestyle changes. Analysis of AAA risk predictive genes in the context of biological networks further identifies functional modules that provide insight into mechanisms of AAA development.

This work simultaneously models AAA risk and mechanism, setting a new precedent for future studies. I particularly liked the analysis of how changes to clinical risk factors impacted predictions of patient outcome for patients with different levels of genetic risk, which illustrates how these factors can be combined in clinical practice to identify patients that could benefit from lifestyle changes.

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate the integration of different layers of data and application of Machine Learning toward improving understanding of disease and improving care.

\item AAA provides an example of complex disease where GWAS can hardly agree on a few risk loci. A review paper was cited (Bradley et al. 2016) - should check this one out.

A milestone and regularly cited review that outlines a number of possible sources of missing heritability.

\subsection{How to define and calculate heritability?}

Narrow-sense heritability \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}}, is the "proportion of phenotypic variance in a population attributable to additive genetic factors"

Broad-sense heritability is not mentioned in the paper.

\subsection{How to know if heritability is missing or not?}

Given the \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}} of a biological marker, one can predict the phenotype on the new set of individuals. If all the heritability has been accounted for, the squared correlation between the observed and the predicted phenotype should be equal to \emph{h\textsuperscript{2}}.

\subsection{Possible sources of missing heritability}

\begin{itemize}

\item rare variants - variants too rare to be detected

\item structural variants, i.e copy number variant, inversions, translocation, microsatellite repeat expansions, etc. - not measurable with techniques of the time, most focus have been on SNPs

\end{itemize}

~

\section{Notes}

Under the light of new research, the causes of missing heritability can be re-organized into

\begin{itemize}

\item technical limitations

\begin{itemize}

\item rare variants - need more power to detect, either by increasing sample size or improve statistical analyses

\item structural variants - largely ignored

\end{itemize}

\item system complexity

\begin{itemize}

\item polygenic and omnigenic traits: phenotype is determined by a large number of genes, each contribute a small effect size

\item epigenetics: factors not obvious in genetic information

\end{itemize}

\item conceptual limitation

\begin{itemize}

\item epistasis: non-additive effects can occur from gene x gene interactions

\item gene x environment interactions

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

If possible, find a newer paper on missing heritability.}

Wearable device designed to capture biotic and abiotic exposure within 2 meter of the participants.

\begin{itemize}

\item Abiotic airbone particles were collected and measured in real time using RTI MicroPEM

\item Biotic samples were collected by the filters before moving to MicroPEM unit

\item Each sampling and monitoring periodlasting for 1-14 days. At the end of such period, filters and cartridges were removed and stored at -80oC. For biotic samples, DNA and RNA were extracted and libraries were prepared for next-gen sequencing.

\end{itemize}

Each sample gave a median of 62.2M (DNA) and 45.8M (RNA) paired-end reads. In total, the data set has 43B DNA and 30B RNA reads. The study covered 15 individuals, sampled over the period of 890 days.

Proteomics informed by transcriptomics: RNA-seq data are acquired on the samples, and then used to build a library of sample-specific amino acid sequences. Mass spectra (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry - LC/MS-MS) are then obtained, and search against this sample-specific amino acid library.

\subsection{9p21.3 locus}

\begin{itemize}

\item A block of SNPs associated first with CAD and later with multiple phenotypes (primary open angle glaucoma, normal pressure glaucoma, glioma, type-2 diabetes)

\item in an intergenic region adjacent to the genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)}

\begin{itemize}

\item Caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries

\item Progress:

\item Accumulation of fat (cholesterol, triglycerides) -$>$ Taken up by tissue macrophages. These macrophages then form foam cells which produce a lot of chemokines and cytokines. The plaques consist of these foam cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cellular debris are formed on the artery, vulnerable to rupture, can trigger thrombosis, forming blood clots and leading to myocardial infarction.

\end{itemize}

~

\section{Notes}

This paper juxtaposed a number of findings to highlight the confusion about the functional role of this locus in confering the CAD risk.

\begin{itemize}

\item Enhancer function was established with targeted deletion in mice: removing 9p21 sequence leads to reduced expression of CDKN2A/B

\item Chromatin conformation (3C) study + Flourescent in-situ hybridization suggested the physical interactions

\begin{itemize}

\item in the short range with CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP

\item in the long range ($>$ million bp) with INFA21

\end{itemize}

\item Study measuring INFA21 blood level in healthy participants showed no association between the INFA21 level and the risk allele

\item Expression profiling on (cultured) macrophages revealed DE of cytokines and chemokines, but not of INFA21

\end{itemize}

This example illustrates how multiple experiments can create more confusion instead of biological insights.}

\begin{itemize}

\item Bioinformatic Harvester and Sciencenet are proof-of-concept implementation for the idea of searchable biological data/scientific knowledge.

\item Notable points about the contemporary need of resource

\end{itemize}

Although various programs are available for exploring the properties of sets of genes, transcripts, and proteins, the ideal software tool, in my opinion, has yet to be created. Such software would be 1)~free:~publicly available, cross-platform, and open source, with database architecture and algorithms described in peer-reviewed publications; 2)~comprehensive:~able to draw on a wide variety of leading database resources; 3)~updated:~regularly, coordinated with releases of major sequence and functional databases; 4)~smart:~capable of automatically recognizing ID types and thus determining the relevant species and relationships between genes and their products; and 5)~flexible:~allowing a choice of analytical methods and output formats.

\begin{itemize}

\item [Trang] A common pattern coming from the resources presented in this guide is the focus on a single or a small number of research subjects at a time: a gene, a protein, a drug. The typical search results of such query are thus limited to information surrounding that query. Upon request (mostly in the form of hyperlinks), users will be directed to the original database. It is not long before one recognize that the information is too much to be perceived by means of following hyperlinks and scrolling down web pages.

\item Pondering on these resources made me think that bioinformatics training is in dire need to leverage these information and retaining researcher sanity. In order to move forward turning data into knowledge, we need more compact and efficient representation of data (which can be provided by data vis) and more robust synthesis of knowledge (which can be obtained by enhancing bioinformatics literacy, i.e. sufficient proficiency in navigating these data ocean, formulating the questions and performing the required analyses.

This study employs existing data sets to address some key questions regarding the missing heritability problem

1. Complex traits have been known to be attributable to multiple genes, each contribute a small fraction into the phenotypic variance. Is this architecture a common pattern or specific to a few complex traits?

Using loci that have been associated with height, the authors have shown that the distribution of p-values is highly skewed toward small (less significant) p-values, and that low p-value variants accounted for 86\% of heritability.

2. Genetic signals are known to be enriched in active chromatin. Is this enrichment specific for cell type?

It turns out there is little enrichment of significant variants among the cell-type-specific active regions vs universally active ones.

Based on the findings above, the authors proposed the omnigenic model for complex trait, in which a few core genes affect the trait directly, a larger number of peripheral genes affect the traits via these core genes, thus contributing a small but non-zero effect to the phenotypic variance.

This model implies a number of challenges to understand complex traits

\begin{itemize}

\item Comprehensive model system that can capture the interconnectedness of cell regulatory networks

\item Better understanding of regulatory networks, both in experimental techniques and analysis methodology

In contrast to GWAS which test for association of variants in the genome with a given phenotype, PheWAS is the opposite approach where one tests for the association of phenotypes with a variants.

As illustrated in this paper, it can be a complementary tool to GWAS, especially to reveal pleiotropy.

\subsection{Materials and methods}

This analysis used the electrical medical records (EMRs) associated with genomic data collected by the eMERGE network which include 5 institutions at that time. eMERGE network now includes 9 centers and provides a larger data sets accessible through dbGaP.

PheWAS phenotypes are the billing codes taken from EMR. These phenotypes were then matched to the traits in NHGRI catalog to evaluate the extent of replication.

Selected SNPs from NHGRI catalog are tested individually for association with a panel of 1358 phenotypes, using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model adjusted for age, sex, study site and the first three principle components.

~

\subsection{Main results}

\begin{itemize}

\item Replicated a large fraction~(66\%) of associations catalogued in the NHGRI GWAS database.

\item Revealed a number of pleiotropic variants, for example

\begin{itemize}

\item 9p21.3 locus (harboring the gene CDKN2BAS, known for association with coronary artery disease) is found to associate with other phenotypes such as abdominal aortic aneurysms and carotid stenosis after adjusted for comorbidity.

\item rs2647044 (intergenic variant) near HLA-DQB1 associated with 9 phenotypes including many celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and lupus

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}

\item High false positive rate (not sure how the authors estimate this number, but it is reasonably expected, due to the limitations inherent to EMR data)

\item Due to the use of billing code in EMR, "pleiotropy" is clinically defined, thus multiple traits can have the same underlying mechanism and are not truly pleiotropy.

\item Billing codes can be too narrow or too broad in defining a disease, not optimized for computational analysis.

\item eMERGE samples are taken from clinical population which tends to be older and sicker than the general population.

\end{itemize}

Advantage of precision medicine approach

\begin{itemize}

\item More accurate diagnosis and treatment

\item Safer drug prescription

\item Better disease prevention and thus reduction in healthcare cost

\end{itemize}

The need of bioinformatics lies in

processing, visualization, interpretation of a patient multi-omic profile

integration of the profiles with clinical data for mechanistic understanding of their disease, facilitating more personalized treatment

GA4GH Beacon Project - an initiative to develop an open sharing platform which can then be used by data repository to provide data via simple web service without compromising sensitive data.

"Precision bioinformatics"

\begin{itemize}

\item is a branch of translational bioinformatics that specializes in the development of computational infrastructures, methodologies and tools required for clinical studies that adopt a precision medicine paradigm.

\end{itemize}

Bioinformatics problems in precision medicine

\begin{itemize}

\item implement platforms for big data processing and integration (including EHRs)

\item establish secure protocols and standards for data exchange

\item develop computational methods for analysis (visualize, interpret and summarize) in the clinical setting, to facilitate decision-making

\end{itemize}

\section{Notes}

Interesting claim about cancer being the most advanced topic in precision medicine (because we're also looking at cancer as a field with most advanced bioinformatics research)

Although the model of precision medicine may apply to many diseases, cancer is the disease for which it is clearly most advanced at this time.~

Among the three areas precision bioinformatics indicated above (big data platforms, data exchange protocols and computational methods), the first two areas are general for all bioinformatics research that call for the assembly of large and heterogenous data. The last area depends heavily on the specific biological questions at hands. For example in clinical setting, softwares should aim at facilitating clinical decision making. Such requirement may lead to focus on juxtaposing patient profile against the population, enabling user request for relevant piece of information. In the setting of basic research, the methods and tools are more disease-centric, or gene-centric, instead of being patient-centric.

Evaluate the performance of genetic risk score derived from GWAS variants, for the prediction of many complex diseases including breast cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc.

Predictive power for a disease, measured in Area Under the ROC (AUC) is calculated from a close-form formula involving the the variant frequency, the penetrance, and the prevalence of disease. The formula is derived on the binary encoding of a pathogenic variant: being present of absent in the affected or unaffected individual.

CAD exhibit very small AUC despite having a very large sample size.

\section{Notes}

Interesting result, but not sure what to take from this survey, because the estimate of AUC is theoretical and there is not enough information on how the values of variables in the AUC formula were obtained.

\subsection{Architecture}

DataSHIELD server: located behind the data owner's firewall, hosting the data.

Opal: R environment pre-configured with DataSHIELD package, R parser that only allows DataSHIELD functions to run

DataSHIELD client:

DataSHIELD client-side packages, providing functions that make call to server-side functions

\subsection{Client-server function pairs}

Only the server-side functions can have access to individual-level data

Analytical functions are essentially the extension of R functions, with modifications such that disclosive results won't be returned. (For example, means and quantiles won't be evaluated for 0\% and 100\%, print() is not supported, contingency table must have all cells with count $>$= 5 to be reported, etc.

Supported analytics

\begin{itemize}

\item Summary statistics (mean, quantiles, etc)

\item Histogram

\item Generalized linear model

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-step integration}

\subsubsection{Calculate stage-specific transcription factor binding probability}

\begin{itemize}

\item Build logistic regression models that predict the binding preference of 17 TFs on 2 cell types

\item Input features

\begin{itemize}

\item Hit of positional weight matrix (PWM) scan: a hit results in positive response, no hit results in negative response

\item Sequence-based features of nearby genes

\item Expression level of nearby genes

\item Histone marks and RNA-polyII phosphorylation

\end{itemize}

\item Models were trained on 16 TFs and tested on the remaining one.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inferring dynamic regulatory networks during cardiac differentiation}

Added temporal expression profiles (RNA-seq) and perturbation data (ChIP-seq)

Final model can predict, for any given gene involved in cardiac differentiation, which TF(s) are direct regulators and the TFBS.

\subsection{Datasets}

TFBS downloaded from ChIPBase, RNA-seq, histone modification and RNAP from GEO

Perturbation experiments for 189 TFs were compiled manually from previous publications.

\section{Notes}

Demonstrates how different omics layers can be integrated.}

Metabolomics, one of the newer omics technologies, has emerged as a powerful tool for defining changes in both global and cardiac-specific metabolism that occur across a spectrum of cardiovascular disease states. Findings from metabolomics studies have contributed to better understanding of the metabolic changes that occur in heart failure and ischemic heart disease and have identified new cardiovascular disease biomarkers. As technologies advance, the metabolomics field continues to evolve rapidly. In this review, we will discuss the current state of metabolomics technologies, including consideration of various metabolomics platforms and elements of study design; the emerging utility of stable isotopes for metabolic flux studies; and the use of metabolomics to better understand specific cardiovascular diseases, with an emphasis on recent advances in the field. }

    abstract = { Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, but in comparison with genetics, environmental factors have received less attention. Evaluation of environmental determinants of cardiovascular disease is limited by the lack of comprehensive omics approaches for integrating multiple environmental exposures. Hence, to understand the effects of the environment as a whole (envirome), it is important to delineate specific domains of the environment and to assess how, individually and collectively; these domains affect cardiovascular health. In this review, we present a hierarchical model of the envirome; defined by 3 consecutively nested domains, consisting of natural, social, and personal environments. Extensive evidence suggests that features of the natural environment such as sunlight, altitude, diurnal rhythms, vegetation, and biodiversity affect cardiovascular health. However, the effects of the natural environment are moderated by the social environment comprised of built environments, agricultural and industrial activities, pollutants and contaminants, as well as culture, economic activities, and social networks that affect health by influencing access to healthcare, social cohesion, and socioeconomic status. From resources available within society, individuals create personal environments, characterized by private income, wealth and education, and populated by behavioral and lifestyle choices relating to nutrition, physical activity, sleep, the use of recreational drugs, and smoking. An understanding of the interactions between different domains of the envirome and their integrated effects on cardiovascular health could lead to the development of new prevention strategies and deeper insights into etiologic processes that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and susceptibility. }

    abstract = { In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on “Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease” concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM \&lt;2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease–related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. }

    abstract = { There is an exponential increase in biological complexity as initial gene transcripts are spliced, translated into amino acid sequence, and post-translationally modified. Each protein can exist as multiple chemical or sequence-specific proteoforms, and each has the potential to be a critical mediator of a physiological or pathophysiological signaling cascade. Here, we provide an overview of how different proteoforms come about in biological systems and how they are most commonly measured using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics. Our goal is to present this information at a level accessible to every scientist interested in mass spectrometry and its application to proteome profiling. We will specifically discuss recent data linking various protein post-translational modifications to cardiovascular disease and conclude with a discussion for enablement and democratization of proteomics across the cardiovascular and scientific community. The aim is to inform and inspire the readership to explore a larger breadth of proteoform, particularity post-translational modifications, related to their particular areas of expertise in cardiovascular physiology. }

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are small conserved RNA molecules of 22 nucleotides that negatively modulate gene expression primarily through base paring to the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs. The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which miR-1 intervenes in regulation of muscle cell growth and differentiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of bioinformatics tools, biochemical assays, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that (1) insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 receptor are targets of miR-1; (2) miR-1 and IGF-1 protein levels are correlated inversely in models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure as well as in the C2C12 skeletal muscle cell model of differentiation; (3) the activation state of the IGF-1 signal transduction cascade reciprocally regulates miR-1 expression through the Foxo3a transcription factor; and (4) miR-1 expression correlates inversely with cardiac mass and thickness in myocardial biopsies of acromegalic patients, in which IGF-1 is overproduced after aberrant synthesis of growth hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a critical role of miR-1 in mediating the effects of the IGF-1 pathway and demonstrate a feedback loop between miR-1 expression and the IGF-1 signal transduction cascade.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aging populations show higher incidences of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). Cardiac remodeling post-MI leads to progressive impaired cardiac function caused by a disarray of several processes including derailed autophagy. Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are known to be key players in cardiovascular disease but their involvement in cardiac autophagy and aging is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify new miRNA candidates that regulate cardiac autophagy and aging. METHODS: We exploited a high-throughput, fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based green fluorescent protein-LC3 detection method to measure the autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes after transfection of a precursor miRNA library consisting of 380 miRNAs. This was followed by a series of molecular and in vivo studies. RESULTS: Together with additional expression screenings, we identified miR-22 as an abundant and strong inhibitor of the cardiac autophagy process. Cardiac miR-22 expression levels increased during aging of mice as well as in aging neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro by a P53-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of miR-22 in aging cardiomyocytes in vitro activated autophagy and inhibited cellular hypertrophy. Pharmacological inhibition of miR-22 post-MI in older mice activated cardiac autophagy, prevented post-infarction remodeling, and improved cardiac function compared with control subjects. Interestingly, similar effects were less pronounced in younger mice with significantly lower cardiac miR-22 expression levels. In addition, circulating levels of miR-22 in 154 patients with systolic HF were highly associated with early mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that miR-22 is an important regulator of cardiac autophagy and a potential therapeutic target, especially in the older myocardium. Finally, circulating miR-22 provides prognostic information for HF patients, highlighting miR-22 as a promising therapeutic and biomarker candidate for cardiovascular disorders.},

	Abstract = {The kidney has long been invoked in the etiology of essential hypertension. This could involve alterations in expression of specific genes and microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of the present study was to identify, at the transcriptome-wide level, mRNAs and miRNAs that were differentially expressed between kidneys of 15 untreated hypertensive and 7 normotensive white male subjects of white European ancestry. By microarray technology we found 14 genes and 11 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the medulla. We then selected and confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR expression differences for NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, PER1, and SIK1 mRNAs and for the miRNAs hsa-miR-638 and hsa-let-7c. Luciferase reporter gene experiments in human kidney (HEK293) cells confirmed the predicted binding of hsa-let-7c to the 3' untranslated region of NR4A2 mRNA. In the renal cortex we found differential expression of 46 genes and 13 miRNAs. We then confirmed expression differences for AIFM1, AMBP, APOE, CD36, EFNB1, NDUFAF1, PRDX5, REN, RENBP, SLC13A1, STX4, and TNNT2 mRNAs and for miRNAs hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-181a, hsa-miR-196a, hsa-miR-451, hsa-miR-638, and hsa-miR-663. Functional experiments in HEK293 cells demonstrated that hsa-miR-663 can bind to the REN and APOE 3' untranslated regions and can regulate REN and APOE mRNA levels, whereas hsa-miR-181a regulated REN and AIFM1 mRNA. Our data demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs can regulate renin expression. The observed downregulation of 2 miRNAs in hypertension could explain the elevation in intrarenal renin mRNA. Renin, CD36, and other mRNAs, as well as miRNAs and associated pathways identified in the present study, provide novel insights into hypertension etiology.},

Although considerable progress has been made in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of CVD, there is still a critical need for novel diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic interventions to decrease the incidence of this disease. Recently, there is increasing evidence that circulating miRNAs (miRNAs), i.e. endogenous, stable, single-stranded, short, non-coding RNAs, can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for CVD. Furthermore, miRNAs represent potential novel therapeutic targets for several cardiovascular disorders. In this review we provides an overview of the effects of several CVD; including heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension; on levels of circulating miRNAs. In addition, the use of miRNA as therapeutic targets is also discussed, as well as challenges and recommendations in their use in the diagnosis of CVD.},

Recently, rapid development in the mobile computing arena has allowed extended reality technologies to achieve performance levels that remove longstanding barriers to medical adoption. Importantly, head-mounted displays have become untethered and are light enough to be worn for extended periods of time, see-through displays allow the user to remain in his or her environment while interacting with digital content, and processing power has allowed displays to keep up with human perception to prevent motion sickness. Across cardiology, many groups are taking advantage of these advances for education, pre-procedural planning, intraprocedural visualization, and patient rehabilitation. Here, we detail these applications and the advances that have made them possible."

	Abstract = {Transcript abundance and protein abundance show modest correlation in many biological models, but how this impacts disease signature discovery in omics experiments is rarely explored. Here we report an integrated omics approach, incorporating measurements of transcript abundance, protein abundance, and protein turnover to map the landscape of proteome remodeling in a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Analyzing the hypertrophy signatures that are reproducibly discovered from each omics data type across six genetic strains of mice, we find that the integration of transcript abundance, protein abundance, and protein turnover data leads to 75{\%} gain in discovered disease gene candidates. Moreover, the inclusion of protein turnover measurements allows discovery of post-transcriptional regulations across diverse pathways, and implicates distinct disease proteins not found in steady-state transcript and protein abundance data. Our results suggest that multi-omics investigations of proteome dynamics provide important insights into disease pathogenesis in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins have been shown to play important roles regulating multiple biological processes in an array of organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. Using a novel bioinformatics text-mining tool, we studied six categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), namely, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, cerebrovascular accident, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, and valve disease, anticipating novel ECM protein-disease and protein-protein relationships hidden within vast quantities of textual data. We conducted a phrase-mining analysis, delineating the relationships of 709 ECM proteins with the 6 groups of CVDs reported in 1,099,254 abstracts. The technology pipeline known as Context-Aware Semantic Online Analytical Processing was applied to semantically rank the association of proteins to each CVD and all six CVDs, performing analyses to quantify each protein-disease relationship. We performed principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the data, where each protein was visualized as a six-dimensional vector. We found that ECM proteins display variable degrees of association with the six CVDs; certain CVDs share groups of associated proteins, whereas others have divergent protein associations. We identified 82 ECM proteins sharing associations with all 6 CVDs. Our bioinformatics analysis ascribed distinct ECM pathways (via Reactome) from this subset of proteins, namely, insulin-like growth factor regulation and interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, suggesting their contribution to the pathogenesis of all six CVDs. Finally, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis and identified protein clusters predominantly associated with a targeted CVD; analyses of these proteins revealed unexpected insights underlying the key ECM-related molecular pathogenesis of each CVD, including virus assembly and release in arrhythmias.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Integrative mathematical and statistical models of cardiac anatomy and physiology can play a vital role in understanding cardiac disease phenotype and planning therapeutic strategies. However, the accuracy and predictive power of such models is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive imaging datasets. The Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) has established a large-scale database of cardiac imaging examinations and associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable, web-accessible, structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes. A goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups. RESULTS: Three main open-source software components were developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client for 3D + time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations. The database was implemented using a three-tier architecture utilizing MySQL, JBoss and Dcm4chee, in compliance with the DICOM standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices. Parts of Dcm4chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters. To date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac imaging examinations are available in the database. All software components developed by the CAP are open source and are freely available under the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.txt).

    abstract = "{Computational biology is essential in the process of translating biological knowledge into clinical practice, as well as in the understanding of biological phenomena based on the resources and technologies originating from the clinical environment. One such key contribution of computational biology is the discovery of biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes using ‘omic’ information. This process involves the predictive modelling and integration of different types of data and knowledge for screening, diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Moreover, this requires the design and combination of different methodologies based on statistical analysis and machine learning. This article introduces key computational approaches and applications to biomarker discovery based on different types of ‘omic’ data. Although we emphasize applications in cardiovascular research, the computational requirements and advances discussed here are also relevant to other domains. We will start by introducing some of the contributions of computational biology to translational research, followed by an overview of methods and technologies used for the identification of biomarkers with predictive or classification value. The main types of ‘omic’ approaches to biomarker discovery will be presented with specific examples from cardiovascular research. This will include a review of computational methodologies for single-source and integrative data applications. Major computational methods for model evaluation will be described together with recommendations for reporting models and results. We will present recent advances in cardiovascular biomarker discovery based on the combination of gene expression and functional network analyses. The review will conclude with a discussion of key challenges for computational biology, including perspectives from the biosciences and clinical areas.}",

\subsection{P3G}

Universal researcher ID to allow granting access to genomic databases and revoking access upon infringement of the terms

\subsection{George Church}

New insights come from integrative analysis, thus relying on sharing data across the fields with people in various fields, usually not given direct permission on the data.

Model: obtain fully informed consent which educate people about the risk (Example: Havard Personal Genome Project requires participant to go through a consent of 20 questions strictly required to be answered correctly).

\subsection{University of Oxford Ethox Centre}

Increase in the amount and variety of data makes it impractical to promise complete privacy to participants in genomic research.

\subsection{Results}

confirmed previous association between CAD and low-frequency missense variants in LPA and PCSK9

discovered associations between CAD and low-frequency missense variants in SVEP1 and ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4)

sequencing of ANGPTL4 leads to identification of 10 loss-of-function alleles, suggesting that ANGPTL4 variants lower the CAD risk by lowering triglyceride levels.

\subsection{Remarks}

[by the authors] the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip version 1.0 covers only 80\% of coding variants in persons of European ancestry that have an allele frequency of 0.1\% or higher.}

\begin{itemize}

\item Exome sequencing of 3734 participants, statistical tests for association of rare variants (individually, or in aggregation within a gene) with plasma triglyceride levels

\begin{itemize}

\item Aggregated variants within a gene: when variants are too rare to be analyzed individually with sufficient power, gene becomes the unit of association analysis (rather than variant).

\end{itemize}

\item Aggregate of rare mutations in APOC3 (encoding apolipoprotein C3) associated with lower plasma triglyceride levels. Mutations being aggregated include 1 nonsense, 2 splice-site, 1 missense.

\item Carriers have lower triglyceride levels, lower circulating levels of APOC3 and lower risk of coronary heart disease.

\item "Loss-of-function" is defined by the functional consequences of the variant: if it introduces a frameshift, pre-mature stop codon, breaks splice-sites, ... it is automatically loss-of-function. Missense variants are not conclusively LoF, but in this context, the missense variant A43T was associated with lower plasma triglyceride, thus "suggested to be loss-of-function"
